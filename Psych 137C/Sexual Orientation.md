* Same-sex relationship statistics
	* Same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states since 2015
	* 1.2 million same-sex households (60% married, 40% unmarried) as of 2021
	* Same-sex marriages are 1/3 of 1% of all marriages (55% women, 45% men)
	* 17% of same-sex households have children
	* Likely to be underestimates, and changing rapidly
* **Sexual orientation** - older research focuses on what gender one is attracted to, but modern research defines it w.r.t. 5 dimensions:
	* Sexual arousal - physiological, how your body responds to stimuli
	* Sexual attraction - mental/psychological, who you fantasize about
	* Romantic attraction - who you want emotionally
	* Sexual behavior - independent of other dimensions
	* Sexual identity - what label you use to describe yourself
	* Components often but not always align
	* Complicates studying different populations
* **Sexual fluidity** - each component of sexual orientation can change over time
	* Men more likely to identify as exclusively gay/straight
	* Women more likely to report sexual fluidity over time
* Methodological issues *(see [[Methods]])*
	* Defining same-sex relationships
	* Finding a sample - in some places there is more stigma, gay bars/bathhouses are not necessarily representative
	* Comparing same-sex and different-sex couples is difficult given recent historical circumstances for same-sex couples
	* Historical changes affect findings - AIDS epidemic, same-sex marriage legalization
* Evidence for similarity
	* Valuing affection and closeness - no differences
	* Satisfaction studies - same range of outcomes
	* Outside judges could not distinguish descriptions of same-sex and different-sex relationships when stripping the descriptions of pronouns
* **Conflict resolution** - better in same-sex couples
	* Gender differences do not contribute to conflict/more empathy due to same gender
	* Same-sex couples value equality more
	* Allocation of housework is not decided w.r.t. gender roles
	* Less hostile conflict discussions
* **Sexuality**
	* Majority of all groups (married/cohabiting/lesbian women and married/cohabitating men) believe **monogamy** is important except for gay men
	* **Sexual frequency** - mixed-gender couples have sex most often after 10 years, followed by gay men and lesbian women, the latter of which has sex much less often
	* **Sexual satisfaction** - highest in lesbian couples, who have longer sex and more frequent orgasms, and lowest in mixed-gender couples
	* The "script" for sex in straight couples is readily available, whereas same-sex couples must communicate
* Context
	* Exposure to discrimination
	* Challenge of disclosure - to parents, society, etc.
	* Lack of social support
	* Different stresses from outside, not within, among same-sex/mixed-gender relationships
* **Dissolution**
	* Same-sex relationships more likely to end - fewer barriers to leaving
	* Same-sex female couples most likely to divorce - women more likely to identify problems and initiate divorce in general
