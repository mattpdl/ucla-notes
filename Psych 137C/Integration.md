### The Question
* If everyone agrees that intimate relationships are to be desired, why do they often fail?

### Elements of An Answer
* Three types of variables:
	* **Enduring traits** - who they are
	* **Adaptive processes** - what they do
	* **External circumstances** - where they are

### Assembling a Model
* Ultimately, everything that affects relationships must do so by *affecting the interactions between the partners*
* Thus adaptive processes are the *engine of change*
* Where do adaptive processes come from?
	* Why are some couples better than others at communication, showing affection, resolving problems, etc.?
	* Characteristics of the partners
	* Characteristics of their environment

### Vulnerability-Stress-Adaptation (VSA) Model
* Behavioral model: Adaptive Processes <--> Change in Satisfaction -> Stay together/break up
* From social exchange theory: consider barriers & alternatives in determining whether a relationship stays together
* Predictors of Adaptive Processes
	* Enduring Characteristics -> Adaptive Processes
	* Enduring Characteristics -> Initial Satisfaction <- External Stressors
	* Initial Satisfaction -> Adaptive Processes
	* External Stressors <--> Adaptive Processes
