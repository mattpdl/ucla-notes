### Why Change is Difficult
* Relationship problems are the #1 reason why people seek counseling
* By the time couples seek counseling, problems are usually severe and several years old
* Couples don't seek therapy because they:
	* Might have negative attitudes towards therapy
	* Think their problems are too small to justify therapy (before they snowball into serious ones)
	* Believe therapy is a lost cause at the point of severe relationship deterioration

### Intervention Strategies
* **Tertiary prevention** - treat the disease, i.e. couples therapy
* **Secondary prevention** - help those at risk, e.g. seminars & self-help books
* **Primary prevention** - prevent the disease, e.g. premarital counseling & enrichment

##### Couples Therapy
* Typically one therapist and both partners for 15-20 weekly sessions that are 60-90 minutes long
* Therapists can have a variety of backgrounds and training
* At times standard couples therapy is "contraindicated" (should not be received), in the case of:
	* Serious individual problems (e.g. substance abuse)
	* High levels of IPV
	* Ongoing affair
	* Specialized interventions exist for these problems
* Common Problems as Rated by Therapists (most damaging & difficult to deal with *italicized*)
	* *Communication (87%)*
	* *Power struggles (62%)*
	* *Unrealistic expectations (50%)*
	* Sex (47%)
	* Solving problems (47%)
	* Showing affection (45%)
	* Money/Finances (43%)
	* *Lack of loving feelings (40%)*
	* Children (38%)
	* Serious personal issues (38%)

##### Systems Models
* *Assumptions:* Problems arise not from faults in partners themselves, but because of patterns that are ineffective for meeting new demands that couples face
* *Tools:*
	* Identify unspoken rules and assumptions of the couple
	* **Reframing** a problem as a set of adaptive behaviors that need to change
	* Identifying patterns instead of casting blame

##### Behavioral Models
* *Assumptions:*
	* Distress arises when partners engage in behaviors that magnify differences and reward negative interactions
	* Behaviors are not a sign of a problem; behaviors *are* the problem
* *Tools:*
	* **Traditional behavioral couples therapy (TBCT)**
	* **Cognitive behavioral couples therapy (CBCT)**
	* **Integrative behavioral couples therapy (IBCT)** - focus on behaviors that can be changed and accepting those cannot
		* **Empathic joining** - building empathy and guiding each partner to validation of each other's feelings and desires
		* **Unified detachment** - encourage partners to distance themselves from their conflicts and address problems impartially
		* **Tolerance building** - helping one partner understand the origins of the other's behavior and attempting to develop acceptance for those behaviors

##### Emotion Models
* *Assumptions:*
	* Distress is a result of not feeling safe and secure in the relationship
	* Primary vs. secondary emotions
* *Tools:*
	* De-escalation of negative cycles
	* Encourage expression of core emotions and healthy responses to such expressions
	* Help couples see their relationship as a safe place to express deep feelings and overcome one's own history in relationships

### Effectiveness & Efficacy of Intervention Strategies
##### Does Couples Therapy Work?
* **Efficacy**
	* Under controlled settings, whether the intervention *can* produce lasting effects
	* This is what *most* research addresses
* **Effectiveness**
	* In the real world, whether the intervention *does* produce lasting effects
* Best data for behavioral & emotion models:
	* TBCT is a benchmark intervention now
	* Far less research on systems models
* Evidence for efficacy:
	* Treated couples generally feel better and have lower divorce rates than untreated couples
	* About 70% maintain their gains over two years
	* Emotion-focused therapies have similar success rates
* Significant improvement doesn't mean that distressed couples are made happy
	* Only 40-50% of couples are no longer distressed by the end of therapy
* Relapse rates are high, at between 30-50%
* Effectiveness is much lower than efficacy, as real distressed couples are very difficult to change

##### The Case for Primary Prevention
* Early on in relationships, motivation might be high
* Prevention may be easier than treatment
* Collateral damage can be avoided (e.g. health, children, work)
* Potential is great for reaching many couples
* Prevention programs:
	* Available in many forms, but content, duration, & cost vary widely
	* Frequently offered through religious organizations
	* Consumer satisfaction ratings tend to be very high, as *low risk* couples are more likely to attend/use

##### Does Primary Prevention Work?
* Most prevention programs are not based on research nor have been tested systematically
* Some evidence that skills-based programs improve communication, but also evidence that communication change is not required
* Some evidence that effects fade quickly, especially taking into account the effects of external forces

##### Secondary Prevention
* Response to preventive interventions is a *function of risk*
	* When risk is high, intervention is better than control
	* When risk is low, control is better than intervention
* Secondary prevention is probably more viable than primary prevention
* For low risk couples, being told that their methods of conflict resolution are wrong is harmful in the long run (epitomizes *if isn't broke, don't fix it*)
