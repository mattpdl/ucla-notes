### Children as Witnesses
* Young children are *incredibly sensitive* to the relationships of adults around them
	* Affected by conflict
	* Affected by resolution or not
	* See through mixed messages
	* Demonstrated in studies: more agitated & aggressive with peers after viewing a video of an argument or witnessing a real one, irrespective of calm verbal cues when conflict expressed

##### Why Adult Relationships Matter
* Effects on emotion regulation - demonstrated longitudinally through reports from teachers & adult caregivers
* Effects on self-concept - lower self-esteem, tendency to blame oneself for household conflict
* Sensitization/Desensitization
	* **Sensitization** - more intense reaction upon each instance of something
	* **Desensitization** - less intense reaction upon each instance of something, i.e. less fazed by future conflict
	* Experimental studies have identified a sensitization effect in children - more agitated behavior displayed in repeated exposure to a staged argument between adults while situated in a playroom

### Siblings
* 90% have siblings, with whom conflict tends be more frequent than any other relationship
* Ev psych viewpoint: sibling conflict arises out of competition for parents' attention & resources
* Doll vs. book study: children are naturally more jealous when a parent deflects attention to a baby doll than a book, highlighting the innate tendency to lament differential treatment
* Sibling relationships promote **theories of mind** - older siblings must learn that younger siblings do not have the same knowledge & experiences as themselves
* **False belief test**
* Children with siblings pass the Sally vs. Anne test earlier
	* Anne removes a marble from Sally's basket and places it in her own box unbeknownst to Sally
	* Sally must figure out to look for the marble in Anne's box

### Friendships
* First voluntary relationships and opportunity to shift attachment styles
* Shared imaginative play is crucial for social & intimate development
* Friendships are inherently more egalitarian than hierarchical sibling relationships typically separated by age
* New sources of working models of self & other

##### Dimensions of Friendships
* Size
	* Popular kids (in elementary) do well in life
	* Outcasts/overlooked suffer from emotional problems, etc. later in life
	* Average/controversial kids don't fare much worse than popular kids
	* Quantity doesn't matter as much as having *any* friends at all
* Composition
	* Kids who have friends who date are more likely to date earlier
	* Kids who have friends who do drugs are more likely to try them
	* Overall, composition of friends is very impactful
* Quality
	* Kids who negotiate differences with friends well are likely to do the same in their relationships

### Adolescence
* **Attachment transition** - person sought for security switches from parents to partners
* 9 year olds know what intimate relationships are like, and want relationships themselves by 6th grade
* Adolescent relationships are not just puppy love - often just as intense if not more than adult relationships
* Break-ups in adolescence can trigger major depression
* Consequences of pregnancy, STDs, violence
* Continuity with adult relationships, e.g. conflict in adolescent relationships sets stage for adulthood

### Cohabitation
* Over 50% of married couples in the US live together first, but most cohabitors do not marry
* Types of cohabitors:
	* Engaged or pre-engaged (46%)
	* Coresidential daters (29%) - frequently results in a break-up but rarely leads to marriage beforehand
	* Trial marriage (15%) - often reflects an ambivalence to cohabitation that likely poses a risk for future divorce
	* Substitute marriage (10%) - people who are ideologically opposed to marriage or could not be married legally (e.g. same-sex couples)
* Due to the cultural shift that increased the prevalence of premarital cohabitation, cohabitation before marriage no longer statistically increases the risk of divorce

### Long-Term Relationships
* Over many years:
	* Sex declines (i.e. Penny Jar anecdote)
	* Positivity declines (in a sense, invested in less and taken for granted), but negativity stays the same
	* Satisfaction declines

##### Intimacy in Later Life
* After 65, men are nearly twice as likely to be married than women
	* Men's attractiveness later in life is higher than that of older women
	* Women more likely to be widowed
	* Men less likely to lose their partner and more likely to remarry even if they do
* Experiences with intimacy in earlier life have health & wealth consequences for later life
* Older adults, date, cohabit, and remarry
	* However, older women much more likely to live alone
	* Divorced older adults, especially women, are less wealthy than they would be if they had stayed married
	* Widowed men more likely to be isolated and depressed because their social circle typically depended on their spouse
	* Older adults are dating apps' fastest growing demographic, especially because it gives them the opportunity to meet people with ease they never had previously
* Older adults have less sex overall due to having fewer relationships and health problems, but this gap closes when controlled for relationships status and ability

##### Losing a Partner
* Men at increased risk of depression; women at increased risk of poverty
* Makes no difference if a long-term partner's death is expected or not
* Grief is easier for those who had a stable, loving relationship
* In contrast, those who had an unstable relationship feel more guilt for unresolved conflict
* Increased risk of widowed spouse's subsequent death within 6 months of first partner's loss
