* **Romantic attraction** is more difficult to predict than whether people find others pleasant
* **Physical appearance/attractiveness**
	* Men rate women in a normal distribution
	* Women rate men as less attractive on average
	* Men more likely to message more attractive women, except for the most attractive women
	* Women, on average, will message even the men they find less attractive
* **Halo effect** - people attribute positive qualities to those they find attractive
	* Good looking people get paid more, more likely to be hired and be elected to office, be absolved of their crimes
* **Matching phenomenon** - people couple at relatively equal levels of attractiveness
	* People reach out to others at equal and somewhat higher levels of attractiveness
	* People rate their own partners higher than others
* **Personal characteristics**
	* **Vertical attribute/quality** - one that can be ranked (e.g. attractiveness, honesty, income, health)
	* **Horizontal attribute/quality** - one that cannot be ranked (e.g. food preferences, religion, hobbies, political views)
	* Personality is subjective, but some personal qualities (e.g. neuroticism) are inherently vertical
	* Vertical qualities proven to be more consequential than horizontal qualities in supporting attraction
	* Feeling similar to a partner is a result not a cause of attraction
* **Reciprocity** - the effects of being liked
	* People gravitate towards those who like them (for reasons along the lines of reciprocal altruism)
	* **Gain-Loss Theory**
		* In a study, researchers had participants talk to a confederate with whom they would overhear positive/negative feedback given to another person after their conversation
		* This experiment has been replicated with multiple rounds, demonstrating that people not only better liked those who gave consistently positive feedback (A), but liked most those where feedback improved over multiple rounds (B) and acceptance was seen as earned
		* In contrast, increasingly negative feedback (C) was seen as rejection by the participants
* **Unrequited love** - people are attracted to those who don't reward them
	* People want to win people over
	* Unrequited lovers see themselves as in line B (eventual acceptance) of Gain-Loss Theory
	* Explains the phenomenon of stalking
* **Standards**
	* Stated preferences do not correlate with actual behavior in speed dating studies, because people don't evaluate ideas (cognitively) in the same way they do behavior (emotionally)
	* People's preferences will change when asked to state their standards in an imagined environment (e.g. a bar vs. a library), and whether evaluating strangers or acquaintances
	* **Misattribution of arousal** - men more likely to contact a researcher after being approached for a study on a suspension bridge vs. a parking lot
	* Romantic attraction is a behavioral not a cognitive process
* **Mate selection**
	* **Proceptivity** - state of being open to romantic moves, signaled by men through pompousness and by women through flaunting their appearance
	* **Behavioral interdependence** - echoing the physical state of someone a person is attracted to
	* **Disclosure reciprocity**
