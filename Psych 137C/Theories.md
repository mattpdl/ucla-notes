* **Theory** - a map/interconnected set of beliefs, knowledge, and assumptions of a phenomenon
* **Evolutionary theory** - humans mate prefs are the product of selection pressures in the course of evolution
	* Natural vs. sexual selection
	* Psychological mechanisms
	* Environment of evolutionary adaptedness
	* Theory of parental investment
	* Gender differences - sexual vs. emotional infidelity, mate prefs
	* Cross-cultural similarities *(demonstrated in stinky t-shirt studies)*
	* Focuses more on gender differences than variability, mate selection than changes in relationships 
* **Attachment theory** (John Bowlby) - the nature of bonds formed with primary caregivers in infancy shapes the relationships we have throughout our lives
	* Attachment necessary for survival of the species - secure base, source of info *(demonstrated in visual cliff studies)*
	* Mental models
	* Attachment styles
		* Secure - get close and comfortable with others easily
		* Avoidant - uncomfortable getting close with and trusting others
		* Anxious/ambivalent - worries others are reluctant to get close
* **Contemporary attachment theory**
	* Dimensions of attachment - anxiety, avoidance
	* Implications for adult behavior (e.g. whether a fight raises relationship doubts)
	* Stability/change in attachment over time
	* Advantages/Limitations
		* Explains where standards and expectations for intimacy originate, why people have the same relationship type repeatedly
		* Fails to explain why secure people break up
* **Social exchange theory** - partners eval rewards & costs associated with being in, barriers associated with leaving a relationship + available alternatives
	* Similar to how economic decisions are weighed
		* $Outcome = Rewards - Costs$
	* **Comparison level ($CL$)** - the standard against which one's own relationship outcomes are compared
		* $Satisfaction = Outcome - CL$
	* **Comparison level for alternatives ($CL_{alt}$)** - one's sense of the quality of alternatives available
		* $Dependency = Outcome - CL_{alt}$
	* Predicts break-ups and divorce
		* 20-40% of divorce filers change their mind, due to children, finances, etc.
	* Abusive partners limit their partner's perception and reality of available alternatives
	* Advantages/Limitations
		* Advantages: explains why diff people are more/less satisfied in similar circumstances and why distressed relationships stay together
		* Limitations: how stable, rewarding relationships become unstable, costly ones
* **Social learning theory** - rewarding and punishing interactions affect subsequent behaviors and judgments of satisfaction in a relationship
	* Behavior is the "final, common pathway"
	* Appraisals/evaluations of each interaction accumulate
	* **Escape conditioning** - behavior that aids a partner in avoiding a negative interaction is reinforced
	* Talk table studies - intention and impact un/matched in un/happy couples
	* Advantages/Limitations
		* Advantages: how satisfied relationships change
		* Limitations: where negative behavior originates, whether distressed couples can become happy
* **Social ecological models** - environmental supports and constraints affect how partners think, feel, and act in relationships
	* **Crisis theory (ABC-X model)** - shows how a stressor (A), resources (B), family's perception (C) affect the nature of a crisis (X), but neglects how these factors change over time (except in the double ABC-X model)
	* Measures reactions to stress and takes into account culture
	* Advantages/Limitations
		* Advantages: when vulnerable relationships break up
		* Limitations: where resources come from
* No comprehensive theory of intimate relationships for now
