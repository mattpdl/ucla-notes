### Cognition in Relationships
* Behavioral research assumes that behaviors have inherent meanings, but behaviors are *ambiguous*
* Meaning in relationships comes in part from *behaviors* and in part *how they are interpreted*

### Dysfunctional Beliefs
* Common dysfunctional beliefs
	* *Disagreement is destructive*
	* *Mindreading is expected*
	* *Sex must be perfect*
	* *Men and women are basically different*

### Perceptual Confirmation
* Expectations affect perceptions - people see what they expect to see
* **Rejection sensitivity** - preoccupation with potential rejection, associated with anxious attachment
	* In a study where people talk to a confederate who leaves early deliberately, people with low rejection sensitivity don't have a strong interpretation of the confederate's exit
	* Conversely, people with high rejection sensitivity more likely to report that they fear the confederate did not like them

### Behavioral Confirmation
* Expectations affect behavior - self-fulfilling prophecy
* Research into social interactions among people with depression or low self-esteem engage in excessive **reassurance seeking**
	* Reassurance seeking can tragically lead to the feared rejection sought to be avoided
* Unsurprisingly, men are more social with women whom they see as attractive
	* Notably, being given an indicator that someone is deemed attractive within society leads to perceiving them as more attractive

### High Standards vs. Lower Expectations
* The case for high standards: set high standards that one can meet themself
* The case for lowered expectations: if more realistic

### From Beliefs to Motives
* In ambiguous situations, not dispassionate about the meanings made
* Specific meanings imposed may depend on motives in the moment
* **Enhancement bias** - want to be confident in relationships and not harbor doubts
	* Prefer info that supports and strengthens positive beliefs about a partner/relationship
	* Happy partners view:
		* Their partners more favorably than themselves and than their friends do
		* Their relationships more favorably than others' relationships
* **Verification bias** - people don't want to be surprised and don't want to disappoint
	* Focused on being perceived *accurately* by a partner
* **Diagnosticity bias** - accurate info about a partner/potential partner is highly desirable (e.g. whether they are flirting/interested, based on something trivial such as how long they take to respond to texts)
	* **Transition points** - prompt searches for such info
	* Bigger issue for people with low self-esteem
* **Self-serving bias** - motivated to protect one's own interests in relationships
	* Focused on being perceived as *right*, especially in an argument/conflict
	* Need to be right favors the self over the relationship

### Mechanisms of Motivated Reasoning
* Plan A: *Keep negative info out of awareness*
	* **Selective attention**
	* **Memory bias**
* Plan B: *Minimize negative attention*
	* Adaptive attributions
	* Flexible standards
	* **Downward social comparison** - justify and minimize one's problems as not worse than that of others

### How Relationships Change
* Limits of Ability
	* Negative experiences do not disappear
	* Some things can't or shouldn't be explained away
	* Can't just think yourself a good relationship
* Limits of Motivation
	* Some people need this more than others
	* Role of dependence
* In unhappy relationships, negative perceptions dominate and are processed in less adaptive ways
	* Attend more to partner's negative actions
	* Recall more negative experiences
	* Perceptions become rigid
	* Other relationships/one's alternatives look better
	* Attributions flip
