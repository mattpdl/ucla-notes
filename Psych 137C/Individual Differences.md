* Why study individuals?
	* No one enters relationships as a blank state
	* Differences affect how relationships develop
	* Some qualities are associated with better relationships
* How individuals vary
	* **Traits** - tendencies, relatively enduring characteristics of individuals
	* **Experiences** - personal history of individuals
	* Lewis Terman (Stanford prof) - believed some traits predisposed people to unhappiness in marriage
* **Big Five model of personality**
	* *Extroversion* - sociable, enjoy company
	* *Agreeableness* - sympathetic, warm, cooperative
	* *Conscientiousness* - dependable, ethical, productive, purposeful
	* *Neuroticism* - gravitate to negative moods, anxious, insecure
	* *Openness* - eager for new experience, daring, nonconforming, imaginative
	* Kelly and Conley (1987)
		* Five acquaintances rated each partner's personality within couples
		* Spouses reported divorce and satisfaction at 3 times over 40 year period
		* Above average neuroticism in divorced couples
		* Happy couples had husbands with higher impulse control
* **Dependency Regulation Model**
	* People with *low self-esteem* have worse relationships on average
	* Poor self regard -> Assume others agree -> Devalue partner -> Express discontent -> Relationship falters
	* Partner kept at a distance due to insecurity, resulting in relationship dissolution and confirmation bias/self-fulfilling prophecy
* **Personal history**
	* What happens *before* a relationship affects what happens *in* a relationship
	* **Intergenerational effects** - explain the association between parents' relationship (G1) and one's own relationship outcomes (G2)
		* G1 divorce increases risk of G2 divorce by about 70% in the first 5 years of marriage
		* G1 discord predicts G2 discord, even over 17 years
		* Divorce is better for children with less exposure to conflict, but can be detrimental when earlier and more abrupt
		* Children of divorce more cautious toward marriage although equally motivated to form partnerships
		* Children of divorce more likely to contemplate divorce compared to offspring of intact marriages who are unhappy in their own marriages
		* Maladaptive behaviors identified in children of divorce - perhaps more cautious in dealing with conflict but more likely to engage in destructive behaviors under duress
		* Children of divorce have fewer economic and interpersonal resources because they are spread across two households
		* Children of divorce have weaker family relationships later in life
