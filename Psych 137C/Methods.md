* People disagree about attraction, conflict, and divorce
* Direct experience matters, but experiences differ
* Relationship science measures **constructs** - abstract ideas
* **Operationalization** - translating an abstract idea into concrete terms to study it
	* Several scales to measure love, but all incomplete
	* **Self-reports** - easy and concise, but people aren't always truthful or know the truth
	* **Systematic observation** - verbal, non-verbal, written communication + biological responses
		* Relevant, great detail but expensive and introduces reactivity + meaning of behavior can be ambiguous
* Designing research
	* **Cross-sectional research** - helps with description
	* **Longitudinal research** - helps with prediction
	* Martial satisfaction is a u-shaped curve for those who stay married (decreases and later increases over time, largely due to the timeframe where couples raise children)
	* Taking divorce into account, martial satisfaction generally decreases over time
	* *To measure change, you must study longitudinally*
* Relationships differ among groups and when studying individuals/couples
* Ethical considerations
	* Reactions from asking certain questions themselves
	* Effects and costs vs. benefits of being studied
