* **Sexual satisfaction** associated with relationship satisfaction as a whole
	* Most sex happens within intimate relationships
	* Sex & sexual intimacy rate higher than any other element seen as necessary in a healthy intimate relationship

	* Strongest association identified in people who value sex especially and are anxiously attached
	* Weakest association in avoidant people
	* Involuntary celibacy associated with distress
* **Sexual frequency** correlates with sexual satisfaction
	* Frequency effects are non-linear and taper off at a weekly frequency
	* Experimental treatment where partners were asked to have sex more frequently did not result in increased satisfaction
	* Frequency impacts are not causal as the motivation for sex is more important
* **Sexual techniques**
	* Consistent orgasms correlate with sexual satisfaction
	* Satisfied couples are more likely to experiment with a variety of techniques
	* Non-sex behavior such as stage-setting and staying in bed after sex also impacts sexual satisfaction
* **Responsiveness**
	* The intimacy process model explains the role of communication about sex in how partners feel validation
	* Partners have happier sex lives in relationships with commitment, good communication, and respect

	* Good sex compensates for neurotic and insecurely attached people's vulnerabilities
	* Better health
		* Lowered stress hormones (only in sex with a partner, not masturbation)
		* On the other hand, not many calories burned during sex
* Obstacles to sex
	* Time spent working and caring for children leads to less time alone in couples
	* Widespread availability of porn
		* Partnered men who watch more porn are less sexually satisfied due to a **contrast effect** (finding their partners less attractive)
		* However, partnered women who watch porn tend to be *more* sexually satisfied
		* In general, moderate porn use is not shown to have negative effects
	* Negotiating differences
		* Sex is one of the most difficult topics for couples to discuss directly and often one of the most avoided topics
		* Disagreements seem more personal and threaten a partner's perception of their own attractiveness/desirability
* **Sexual desire** over the course of a relationship
	* Penny Jar story - newlywed couples in the Mormon faith are told to put a penny in a jar every time they have sex in their first year of marriage, then take a penny out each time in the years following (the punchline: they will never run out of change ðŸ˜‚)
	* Sexual frequency and desire declines measurably over the course of a relationship, but typically levels out at some point in the first couple of years (even when controlling for the effects of aging)
	* More of a decline for women than men
