### Why Examine Intimacy in Context?
* Otherwise identical relationships may function differently depending on their contexts
* Relationships *matter more* under stress, yet might function *more poorly* because of it
* People learn about their relationship as a result of how they & their partner manage difficult circumstances

### Situating the Couple
* Environments are multi-layered, each layer of which contains stressors & resources
* **Proximal** & **distal factors** affect couples
	* Distal influences operate on relationships through proximal factors
	* Explained by Bronfenbrenner's **ecological model**
* Context & stress affects:
	* What one talks about with their partner
	* When one interacts with their partner
	* Where one interacts with their partner
	* How much one interacts with their partner

##### Two Route Model of Stress Effects
* Route 1 - The Content of the Relationship
	* Stress -> Specific relationship problems -> Relationship satisfaction
* Route 2 - The Processing of Relationship Problems
	* Stress -> Specific relationship problems + Processing strategies -> Relationship satisfaction

### Consequences of Stress
##### Stress Spillover
* Couples who experience more stress report *lower* satisfaction that *declines more steeply* over time
* Couples who behave *adaptively* when stress is *low* behave differently when stress is *high*
* Study of married air traffic controllers (Repetti, 1987) identified a relationship between stress at work (as measured by flight throughput) and at home (weaker connection to their spouses)

##### Stress Crossover
* One partner's stress causes the other to become stressed

##### Why Relationship Maintenance is Hard
* Couples know how to behave, but knowing what to do is not enough
* Being able to connect is key

##### Can Stress Ever Be Good?
* If stress is a test, what happens when you pass?
	* Passing is good for your relationship's health, not that such a test is necessary for a relationship's success
* The role of resources (i.e., stable conditions)
	* Acute stress has weaker effects when chronic stress is low
	* Financial stress has weaker effects when social support is high

##### What Else Can Be Done About Stress?
* Pay attention to it
* Ironically, stress itself makes this hard to do
* Study of couples studying for the Bar Exam (Bolger) involved diaries of relationship satisfaction, mood, etc. filled out from 4 weeks out
	* Partner's stress better understood by their partner closer to the exam date itself

#### How Does the Environment Constrain Low-Income Couples?
* Poor couples have less time (shift work, non-standard hours)
* Poor couples have less flexible time (fewer vacations, less sick leave, no flexible hours)
* Poor couples have more demands on their time (sick children & relatives)

##### Do External Demands Put Poor Couples at Risk?
* When couples lack shared leisure time, divorce risk goes up
* Married women/men who work nights have 3/6x greater divorce risk

### Implications for Policy
* Promoting intimacy through couple-friendly environments:
	* Health care
	* Child care
	* Minimum wage - states that raised it lowered divorce rates by 10%, adjusting for other factors
	* Money as a marital aid

##### Military Couples: A Counter-Example
* Military couples face severe stress:
	* Deployment
	* Frequent moves
	* Long, unpredictable hours
* Divorce rates within the military are lower than civilians matched on age, ethnicity, & employment
