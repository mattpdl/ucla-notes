* **Relationship maintenance** - the sequence of behaviors and strategies that partners enact to continue a valued relationship
	* Strengthening a good relationship
	* Averting declines
	* Repairing problems
* **Intimacy process model** (Harry Reis) - explains the interaction between the disclosure of feelings from one partner (A), the other partner's response (B), and the first partner's reaction to their partner's response (A)
	* Each partner's emotions/behavior shaped by their own motives, needs, goals, & fears
	* A & B process their respective partner's emotions/behavior through their own interpretative filter
	* A may feel understood, validated, or cared for by B's response
* **Self-expansion theory** (Art Aron) - theorizes that relationships are fulfilling because they are opportunities for self-growth
	* As a result, relationships become less fulfilling as opportunities for growth diminish
	* Active efforts must be made to counteract this
	* Novel & arousing activities empirically demonstrated to increase judgments of satisfaction
* **Capitalization** (Shelly Gable) - behavior that elaborates upon and deepens the experience of positive events
	* Behaviors can be categorized along passive/active (X), destructive/constructive (Y) axes
	* Couples who are constructive and active are most likely to stay together
	* Destructive and passive behavior is dismissive of partner's feelings
	* Destructive and active behavior invalidates partner's feelings
* **Forgiveness** - requires changes at the *intrapersonal* and *interpersonal* levels
	* Depends on:
		* The transgression in question
		* Victim's personality
		* Explanations for the event in question
		* Whether the transgressor expresses remorse
			* Effective apologies after disclosure from the victim require the transgressor to make the victim feel understood, validated, and cared for
		* Qualities of the relationship
	* Not all acts *can* or *should* be forgiven, but a willingness to forgo retaliation and achieve reconciliation generally helps relationships
* **Social support** (Carolyn Cutrona) - responsiveness to another's needs
	* Acts that communicate caring or validate the other's worth, feelings, or actions
	* Facilitating adaptive coping with problems through the provision of information, assistance, or tangible resources
	* Fosters love, trust, tolerance, & commitment
	* Contributes to relationship stability
	* Demonstrated in longitudinal studiess
* **Visible/invisible support** - support *perceived* to be available is always beneficial, whereas support actually *received* can be beneficial but is sometimes detrimental
	* Invisible support is often better when a partner is stressed
		* Studies show weight loss programs were more successful in women when a husband was uninvolved, and that stressed partners were happiest before a bar exam when support was invisible
	* Asking for support may entail emotional costs and obligations
