### History of Studying Couple Conflict
* *Couples therapy* became more acceptable in the 1960s as divorce rates skyrocketed, conflict being the chief complaint
* *Social learning theorists* assumed conflict mismanagement was the primary cause of distress, studied conflict and developed treatments
* **Conflict** (according to Kurt Lewin) arises when one person pursues their goals and interferes with another's goals in doing so
	* Responses to interference vary in many ways
	* *Closeness* increases the potential for conflict

### Research into Conflict
* *Cross-sectional question*: what unhappy couples are doing wrong
* *Longitudinal question*: what behaviors predict future outcomes of a relationship
* Unsurprisingly, researchers have shown that unhappy couples are more negative with each other than happy couples
* However, some subtleties have also been identified in unhappy couples:
	* **Kitchen-sinking** - extrapolating behaviors and surfacing other problems when discussing conflict
	* **Self-summarizing** - repeatedly emphasizing one's own point in pursuit of winning an argument (as opposed to *other-summarizing* which validates a partner's feelings)
	* **Presumptive attributions** - assuming a partner's motives for behavior, likely with some cynicism
	* **Cross-complaining** - avoiding responsibility for a mistake by changing the topic
	* **Prescription** - (w.r.t. to a relationship) demanding what a partner must do or change about themself
	* **Hostile questions** - asked with an intent to antagonize one's partner rather than seek a genuine answer

#### Negative Patterns and Sequences
* Unhappy couples are often unaware of these behaviors in their own relationships
* Tend to be more rigid & predictable
	* **Negative reciprocity**
	* Take longer to exit negative exchanges
* **Cognitive editing** - happy wives (typically) follow partner negatives with neutral behaviors
* **Vertical conflict** has a right & wrong side, whereas **horizontal conflict** has two valid sides
	* Relationships mostly experience horizontal conflict but partners often treat them as vertical conflict

#### Reinforcement
* **Escape conditioning**
* **Demand/withdraw** - feedback loop where greater demands lead to further withdraw in conflict
	* Helps a partner's goal's in the short term but leads to relationship damage in the long term
* **Naive realism** - holding up one's own view of the world as objective and believing that other views are ignorant or naive
* **Actor/observer bias** - tendency to focus on one's own thoughts but others' actions, leading to a misinterpretation of events between people

#### Predicting the Future
* Oddly, negative behaviors do not conclusively predict negative outcomes
* Negative couples *(negative content)* experience faster declines in marital quality, but only when humor, interest, & affection *(positive affect)* are relatively rare
	* In other words, positive emotion overrides the effects of negative content during conflict

### Relationship Violence
* **Intimate partner violence (IPV)** is *relatively common*
	* accounts for 21% of all violence against women, but only 2% of violence against men
	* 1-4M women assaulted by a male partner each year
	* While women are less likely to be victims of crime in general, they are 5-8x more likely to be victims of relationship violence
	* 33% of all murdered women are killed by an intimate partner (according to the DOJ)
	* IPV was long ignored as a rare, extreme behavior, but 12.1% of husbands admitted to physical violence against their spouse in a random sample in 1980
* IPV is *unrelated to relationship satisfaction*
	* Some fallaciously believe that IPV only happens when relationships get bad
	* 50% of newlyweds in studies report physical aggression
	* High rates of violence in premarital couples who went on to get married
* IPV is *mutual*
	* 11.6% of wives admit to physical violence against spouse
	* Wives usually score higher on self-report scales of IPV
	* *Question of impact*: data neglects to account for the motivation and severity of such acts, i.e. whether it is a response to a spouse's aggression
* IPV highest in cohabiting couples > married couples > dating couples
	* IPV as common in college student couples & adolescent couples

#### Types of IPV
* Controversy from battered women's advocacy groups motivated the identification of two different types of IPV
* **Situational couple violence (SCV)**
	* *Characterized by:* 
		* Measured on surveys
		* Motivated by frustration
		* Involves arguing
		* Mutual
		* Reactive & emotional
		* Can still be fatal
	* *Consequences:*
		* Many distressed partners do not view their aggression as a major problem
		* Wives seeking marital therapy rarely list IPV as an important problem despite it being frequently reported
		* Severely aggressive spouses much less likely to remain married than moderately aggressive/nonaggressive spouses, whom are roughly equally likely to stay married
* **Coercive controlling violence** (originally *patriarchal terrorism* or *intimate terrorism*)
	* Defined as a systematic & sustained effort to control and dominate a partner through physical violence, verbal & psychological abuse, sexual coercion & abuse, economic & social control, and threats
	* *Characterized by:*
		* Measured by police and crime records
		* Motivated by desire to control partner
		* Involves physical & emotional abuse
		* Proactive & strategic
	* *Consequences*:
		* Physical injury
		* Psychological problems
		* PTSD
		* Isolation
		* Economic difficulties
		* Trauma to children
		* Death

#### **Cycle of Violence**
* **Tension-building** - male's hostility escalates in the form of angry outbursts
* **Acute battering** - tension unleashed in the form of rage and aggression
* **Contrition phase** - the man apologizes, promises to change, and convinces the woman & others involved that severe abuse will never happen again
* Temporary calm is restored, but promises are forgotten and the man's desire to re-exert control reappears when the tension-building stage begins again

#### Why IPV is Pervasive
* Why Men Batter
	* Early childhood experiences
	* Desire to regain control
	* Traditional gender roles
	* Powerlessness
	* Antisocial & dysphoric-borderline personality disorders
	* Jealousy
	* Alcohol/substance abuse
* Why Women Stay
	* Fear
	* Financial dependence
	* Social isolation
	* Insufficient resources & info
	* Passivity & learned helplessness
	* Self-blame
	* Norms of gender & culture
	* Love
* Helping Violent Couples
	* For SCV:
		* Anger management
		* Communication skills
		* Couple therapy
	* For CCV:
		* Help the victim escape
