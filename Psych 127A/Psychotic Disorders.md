## Psychosis
* Loss of contact w/ reality, disturbances in thinking/perception
* Experiences, episodes, & disorders
### Symptoms
* Hallucinations (pos.)
* Delusions (pos.)
* Disorganized speech
* Characteristic but not specific to psychosis:
	* Disorganized behavior
	* Neg. symptoms
	* Difficulties w/ attention, learning, memory (cognitive)
* Symptoms categorized as pos., neg., disorganized, & cognitive
#### Hallucinations
* Sensory experiences/perceptions in the *absence* of stimulus/sensory input
* **External attribution** - experienced as separate from the self
* Not the same as **illusions** - momentary misinterpretation of an actual stimulus/sensory input
* Can involve 1+ sensory domain
##### Auditory
* Most common type of hallucination, often verbal
* 1 or multiple voices talking to/about the person (sporadic/running commentary)
* Might involve telling the person what to do *(command hallucinations)*
* Neuroimaging studies show brain activation in Broca's area - speech production region
##### Visual
* Seeing shadows, shapes, animals, people
* Vague & distorted / clear & fully-formed
* Fleeting (goes away when looked at) / fixed (able to look at/engage)
##### Olfactory
* Smelling smells/odors, often unpleasant

##### Gustatory
* Strange tastes when eating/drinking e.g. tasting spice/bitterness
#### Delusions
* Strong, inaccurate, unusual thoughts/beliefs that persist in the face of conflicting evidence
* Results in mental misrepresentation of reality
* Beliefs outside the norm of person's culture
* Content may be *bizarre* (could not occur in real life) or *non-bizarre* (unrealistic but not impossible)
	* e.g. belief that your internal organs were removed & replaced w/ someone else's vs. belief that one is under constant police surveilance
##### Types of Delusions
* **Delusions of reference** - belief that external signals have a special significance/meaning just for them
	* e.g. songs on the radio played for them, billboards/commercials sending special messages
* **Persecutory delusions** - belief that others are trying to watch/harm them
	* e.g. being followed/poisoned/wronged
* **Grandiose delusions** - belief that one is skilled/important/has powers

	* **Thought insertion** - thoughts being put into one's head
	* **Thought control** - thoughts being changed/monitored
	* **Thought broadcasting** - thoughts being played out loud so others can hear them
#### Disorganized Speech
* Confusing/abnormal speech
	* Failure to make sense despite being produced clearly
	* Some conformity to language rules is preserved
* Reflects disorganized/confusing/abnormal thought process/organization **(formal thought disorder)**
* Not attributed to lack of education, intelligence, etc.
##### Types of Disorganized Speech
* **Derailment** - loosening of associations
	* Difficulty maintaining the topic of conversation
	* **Flight of ideas** - derailment + pressured output
* **Tangentiality** - giving answers in an unrelated/derailed manner
	* Differs from **circumstantiality** - giving excessively long-winded answers, but ultimately reaching the goal
* **Incoherence** - "word salad", words & phrases strung together seemingly nonsensically
* **Neologisms** - creation of new idiosyncratic words
#### Disorganized Behavior
* **Disorganized affect** - inappropriate emotional behavior
	* e.g. laughing/crying in an exaggerated fashion/at strange times
* Inappropriate/unproductive/unusual behavior
	* Lack of bathing, wearing clothes that do not match the weather

	* Tends to be severe
	* **Echolalia** - repetition of words/behaviors
#### Negative Symptoms
* Things that should be there, but aren't
	* **Positive symptoms** - presence of things that shouldn't be there
* Characterized by a reduction/absence (5 A's)
	* **Avolition** - lack of motivation/apathy
	* **Alogia** - "A Logos" or w/o words => reduced speech output
	* **Anhedonia** - lack of pleasure/interest in activities
	* **Asocilaity** - social withdrawwla
	* **Affective flattening** - muted expression of emotion (both pos. & neg.)
#### Cognitive Symptoms
* Sometimes grouped together w/ disorganized symptoms
* Difficulties across a range of cognitive domains
	* Attention: initiating & sustaining focus
	* Working memory: mental manipulation of info
	* Learning & memory: retention & recall
	* Speed of processing: generally slowed
	* Executive functioning: reasoning, problem solving, decision making
### Characterizing Psychotic Disorders
* Psychotic experiences may be observed in other disorders
* **Psychotic episode** - symptoms that are psychotic-level (in terms of frequency & severity) + impairing and/or distressing
* **Psychotic disorder** - psychotic episodes not due to another condition
	* Diagnosis based on no., type, & duration of symptoms
	* Schizophrenia spectrum
### Statistics
* 3% lifetime prevalence of psychosis
* 10% general pop. have psychotic experiences
	* ~30% develop a psychotic disorder
* High risk for suicidality
	* 12-15% people w/ a psychotic disorder complete suicide
	* ~75% youth w/ psychotic-level symptoms attempt suicide
## Schizophrenia
* DSM-5: 2+ of the following present for a significant portion of time during 1 mo. period:
	* Delusions
	* Hallucinations
	* Disorganized speech
	* Grossly disorganized/catatonic behavior
	* Neg. symptoms
* For significant portion of time since onset of disturbance, level of func'g in 1+ major areas is markedly below premorbid estimates
* Continuous signs of disturbance persist for 6+ mo.
### Statistics
* Prevalence: ~1% general pop.
* Age at onset: typically 18-25 but can emerge at any time, childhood cases very rare
* Sex differences: affects males & females equally, w/ better long-term prognosis in women
* Cultural factors:
	* Some symptoms culturally normative, not always pathologized
	* Found at similar rates across cultures
	* Similar symptoms across cultures, but content varies
	* Within the US, ethnic minorities more likely to receive this diagnosis
### Prodromal Phase
* Up to 85% people who develop schizophrenia go through **prodromal stage** - 1-2 yr. period before fully-psychotic symptoms emerge but when less severe, unusual behaviors start to show themselves
	* Non-specific, subclinical, attenuated symptoms
* Symptoms may also signal *impending relapse* in patients who have already been diagnosed, but differs from prodromal stage
#### Symptoms
* Feeling something is "not quite right"
* Jumbled thoughts & confusion
* Experiencing unfounded fear
* Hearing sounds/voices that are not there
* Declining interest in people, activities, & self-care
* Having trouble communicating
### Phases
* **Prodromal** - early warning signs
* **Active/acute** - symptoms of fully psychotic severity
* **Residual** - tapering down of symptoms to individual's new baseline until next episode's onset
* Generally applies to pos. symptoms
### Outcomes
* Generally chronic
* Many show improvements, but neg. & cognitive symptoms often persist
* Functional impairment
	* Most suffer w/ moderate-severe lifetime impairment
	* 75% go on to develop disability
	* <20% gainfully employed
	* ~5% experience chronic homelessness
* Quality of life
	* Lower life expectancy than general pop.
	* Assoc'd w/ poorer general health (e.g. diabetes, obesity) & health decisions (e.g. smoking)
	* Inc'd risk for suicide
	* High rates of victimization & stigmatization
### Risk Factors
#### Developmental
* Parent age: more significant for fathers, older parents
* Parental education: especially maternal, higher parental education poses lower risk
* Conception, pregnancy, birth
	* Maternal illness during pregnancy e.g. infection
	* Maternal weight/body mass
	* Season of birth w/ winter birth posing higher risk
	* Prev. pregnancies (<1 / >4)
	* Obstetric complications
		* Hypoxia
		* Fetal distress
		* Anorexia/anemia in pregnancy
		* Third trimester bleeding
		* Cord knotted/wrapped
		* Prematurity
		* Prenatal infections
#### Genetics
* Inherited risk likely to involve multiple genes
* Risk increases w/ genetic relatedness
	* Monozygotic twins: 48-50% concordance
	* Dizygotic twins: 10-17% concordance
* COMT gene provides instructions for making catechol-O-methyltransferase, an enzyme that degrades catecholamines inc. dopamine
	* People w/ COMT gene more likely to become psychotic if they have used cannabis during adolescence
#### Environmental
* Adoptee risk remains high if a biological parent has schizophrenia
	* Children in foster care:
		* 16% children of biological mothers w/ schizophrenia developed the disorder
		* 0% children of controls developed schizophrenia
* Retrospective study of adults w/ schizophrenia who were adopted
	* Higher rates of schizophrenia in biological relatives (13%) than adoptive relatives (1%)
* Healthy environments are protective
	* Risk lower in children w/ bio. parent w/ schizophrenia if child raised by parents who do not have it
	* Foster care study: only youth at risk for schizophrenia were raised in adverse adoptive env.
#### Neurotransmitters
* Dopamine hypothesis: schizophrenia partially caused by overactive dopamine
	* Amphetamines (dopamine agonists) can induce hallucinations & delusions in habitual users
	* Antipsychotic medications (dopamine antagonists) can decrease positive symptoms
	* Logical implication is that excess dopamine activity causes psychotic symptoms
* Lack of support for pure dopamine hypothesis:
	* 30% people w/ schizophrenia do not respond to dopamine antagonist medications
	* Drugs take several days to affect symptoms
* Likely many neurotransmitters involved
* Current model: interactions b/t dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate
#### Brain Abnormalities
* Enlarged ventricles & reduced tissue volume
* **Hypofrontality** - less active frontal lobes, a major dopamine pathway
* Not unique to schizophrenia
#### Childhood Risk Factors
* Impaired social & emotional functioning
	* Depression/anxiety
	* Attention problems
	* Aggression
* Poor motor functioning
* Lower cognitive functioning (low IQ)
* Language dysfunction
#### Family Stress
* May contribute to activating underlying vulnerability (diathesis-stress)
* May incr. risk of relapse
* Expressed emotion in the family:
	* High expressed emotion (EE): assoc'd w/ relapse
	* Critical comments
	* Hostile remarks
	* Emotional over-involvement
* Several disorders impacted by living in family w/ high EE
* Reciprocal relationship b/t patient behavior & family's attitudes
#### Stressors
##### Social & Emotional
* More stressful life events -> Higher relapse
* Change in living situation: illness in family member, crime, auto accident
##### Economic 
* Drift hypothesis: deteriorating mental health results in lower socioeconomic status -> incr. stress
* Social causation: lower socioeconomic status -> stress -> dev't of mental illness (chronic stress of poverty)
##### Relapse
* High EE/Life events -> Symptoms/Relapse
	* Biological mechanisms: cortisol
* High EE/Life events <-> Symptoms/Relapse
	* Symptoms -> Stressful life events -> Symptoms
	* Symptoms -> Frustration for family -> Family coping involves criticism & intrusion -> Symptoms
### Treatment
#### Typical Antipsychotic Medications
* Conventional neuroleptic medications began use in the 1950s
* Historically first line treatment for schizophrenia
	* e.g. Haldol, Thorazine, Trilafan, Prolixin, etc.
* Blocking dopamine -> Reduces/eliminates pos. symptoms
	* 50% show improvement in 6 wks.
	* 25% do not improve due to more neg./disorganized symptoms
	* 65-75% relapse if meds discontinued
	* 40% relapse if meds maintained
* Acute & permanent side effects common
	* **Tardive dyskinesia** - causes stiff, jerky, uncontrollable movements of the face & body
		* e.g. blinking eyes, sticking out tongue, lip puckering, waving arms
* Other side effects: drowsiness, dry mouth, weight gain
* Compliance w/ medication is often a problem
#### Atypical Antipsychotic Medications
* Second-generation antipsychotics: e.g. Abilify, Risperdal, Seroquel, Zyprexa, Clozaril, etc.
* Affect dopamine & serotonin pathways
	* Decrease dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway (dopamine reward pathway) -> Reduces pos. symptoms
	* Bind loosely to dopamine receptors, decreasing likelihood of extrapyramidal symptoms like tardive dyskinesia
	* Block serotonin which increases dopamine in the mesocortical pathway, also decreasing likelihood of EPS
* As effective as typical meds in reducing pos. symptoms
* Not very effective in improving neg. & cognitive symptoms
* Better medication compliance b/c fewer motor side effects
* New side effects: drowsiness, weight gain, tired, depressed, drop in white blood cell count, increased stroke risk, cardiac death, blood clots, diabetes
* 20% people do not respond to meds
* >50% will not achieve 50% reduction in symptoms
#### Assertiveness Community Treatment (ACT)
* Medically monitored non-residential service
* ACT team generally includes psychiatrist, social workers, nurses, occupational therapists, peer support specialists, & more
* ACT offered 24 hr/day, 7 days a wk
	* Most clients have multiple contacts w/ team members each week
	* Medication prescribing & mgmt
	* Help w/ employment, housing, finances, medical appointments, legal problems
	* Life skills: housekeeping, shopping, cooking, & transportation
	* Family education
#### Illness Management & Recovery (IMR)
* Motivational, educational, & cognitive-behavioral techniques to engage clients as active participants in their care
	* Learn about mental illnesses & strategies for treatment
	* Reduce relapse & re-hospitalizations by identifying early warning signs & developing a relapse prevention plan
	* Learn to create networks of social support to enhance recovery
	* Learn coping strategies for persistent symptoms
	* Develop recovery goals & implement plan of action for goal achievement
* Individual/group format for 3-6 mo.
#### CBT
* Goals: improve person's ability to function independently, manage schizophrenia, & reduce distress experienced in daily life
* Techniques:
	* Cognitive restructuring
	* Behavioral experiments/reality testing
	* Self-monitoring
	* Coping skills training
* Emphasis on being non-confrontational & on normalizing psychotic experiences in so much as they are on a continuum w/ non-psychotic experiences
* Can focus specifically on psychotic symptoms e.g. hallucinations/delusional beliefs
* Also helps address depression and/or anxiety assoc'd w/ psychotic symptoms and their impact on the persons's life
#### Family Therapy
* Focus on preventing relapse
* Psychoeducation & skill building
	* Symptoms, medications, stress, role of family in illness' course
	* Realistic expectations
	* Low stress env.
	* Pos. requests for change
	* How to express neg. feelings about patient's behaviors
	* Coping w/ patient's symptoms
		* Neg. symptoms & poor social/role functioning are biggest stressors on the family
* Relapse rates over 1 yr. period:
	* High EE families w/o intervention: 48%
	* High EE families w/ intervention: 9%
* Difficult to maintain treatment gains over time
	* Hard to continue to cope w/ chronic illness & significant disability
#### Skills Training
* Independent living training
* Job skills training & vocational rehabilitation
* Social skills
	* Focus on neg. symptoms, poor functioning
	* Structured, educational approach that involves modeling, role-playing, & social reinforcement
	* Group format, reinforcement of prosocial behaviors
