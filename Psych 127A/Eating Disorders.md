## Eating Disorders
* **Anorexia nervosa (AN)** & **bulimia nervosa (BN)**
	* Severe disruptions in eating behavior
	* Weight & shape have disproportionate influence on self-concept
	* Extreme fear & apprehension about gaining weight
	* Strong sociocultural origins
		* Emphasis on thinness
		* Occurs more freq'ly in higher income countries
* **Binge eating disorder** - involves disordered eating behavior but may involve fewer cognitive distortions about weight & shape
### Lifetime Prevalence
* Anorexia nervosa - 1.4% women, 0.2% men (7x rate in women)
* Bulimia nervosa - 1.9% women, 0.6% men (3x rate in women)
* Binge eating disorder - 2.8% women, 1.0% men (3x rate in women)
* Higher rates in athletics. dance, modeling, competitive environments e.g. college
### Developmental Trajectory
* AN most likely to develop 15-19 yrs.
* BN most likely to develop in women ages 20-24
* Binge eating more common in ages 30-50
### Anorexia Nervosa
* *Restriction* of energy intake relative to reqs leading to a significantly low body wt.
* *Intense fear* of gaining wt. or becoming fat
* *Persistent behavior* that interferes w/ wt. gain, despite low wt.
* *Disturbance* in way body wt./shape is experienced
	* Undue influence of body wt./shape on self-eval
	* Persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of current low body wt.
* Affects whole body & is assoc'd with numerous medical complications
* Highest risk of death (5-15%) among mental disorders (2x-3x that of schizophrenia & bipolar, respectively)
### Binge Eating
* Eating excess amounts of food in a discrete period of time
* Eating perceived as uncontrollable
* May be assoc'd w/ guilt, shame, regret
* May hide behavior from family members
* Foods consumed often high in sugar/fat/carbs
* **Binge eating disorder** - recurrent episodes of binge eating
### Bulimia Nervosa
* Recurrent episodes of *binge eating*
* Recurrent inappropriate *compensatory behavior* in order to prevent weight gain
	* Self-induced vomiting/purging (most common)
	* Misuse of laxatives, diuretics, other medications
	* Fasting
	* Excessive exercise
* Binge eating & compensatory behaviors occur at least once/wk. for 3 mo.
* *Self-evaluation* unduly influenced by body shape & wt.
#### Complications of BN
* Most people w/ bulimia w/in 10% of normal body wt.
* Purging methods can result in severe medical problems
	* Erosion of dental enamel, electrolyte imbalance, enlargement of salivary glands, rupture of esophagus
	* Kidney failure, cardiac arrhythmia, seizures, intestinal problems, colon damage
## Causes
* Biological - inherited vulnerability or excessive neurobiological response to stress assoc'd w/ impulsive eating
* Psychological = anxiety focused on appearance/presentation, distorted body image
* Social - cultural pressures to be thin, family/social circle interactions/pressures
### Biological
* Hereditary tendency
* Serotonin dysregulation modulates mood & appetite
* BN: disturbance in feeling satisfied w/ food after eating
* Brain differences:
	* **Insula** - area of the brain where taste is sensed & integrated w/ reward to help determine whether an individual hungry/full
	* Not triggered in same way as controls
* Physiological differences 
	* In AN, diminished response to taste of sucrose & other foods e.g. chocolate milk
	* In BN, heightened response to taste of sucrose
* Reward sensitivity in AN:
	* Enhanced ability to delay gratification compared to healthy volunteers
	* Low reward reactivity (during both ill & recovered states)
	* Anticipation of food (often triggering dopamine-reward center) makes them anxious
	* Food not as rewarding & is stressful
### Family Relationships
* Greater family conflict, rejection reported by some w/ eating disorders
* Many report non-conflictual, cohesive relationship in their families
* Anorexia:
	* Parental over-direction of child or subtle discouragement of autonomous strivings
	* Over-involved/controlling families as more rigid, less cohesive, & poorer communication skills than healthy controls
* Bulimia:
	* Perceptions of less cohesion than families of healthy controls
	* High parental expectations
	* Critical comments from family members about shape, weight, eating
* Childhood sexual abuse
### Psychological
* Perfectionism
* Poor interoceptive awareness
* Low self-esteem
* Neg. mood states
* Neg./distorted body image
* Dietary restraint
* Preoccupation w/ food
### Sociocultural
* Media portrayals: thinness linked to success, happiness
* Cultural emphasis on dieting
* Standards of ideal body size that are difficult/impossible to achieve
* Cross-cultural & historical differences exist
## Treatment
### Anorexia Nervosa
* Emergency procedures to restore wt.
* Antidepressants/other medications
* Family therapy (Maudsley model): 42% response rate
* Cognitive-behavioral therapy: 17% response rate
#### Maudsley Model (Family-Based Therapy)
* Parents and/or caregivers play an active & pos. role in:
	* Aiding in restoring their child's wt. to normal & expected levels
	* Helping control their child's eating & return control to teen when appropriate
	* Encourage normal teen dev't through family therapy
### Bulimia Nervosa
* Antidepressants & other medications
	* Can help reduce binging & purging behavior
	* Usually not efficacious in long-term
* Cognitive-behavioral therapy
	* *Treatment of choice*
	* Meal planning, nutritional educ., ending binge/purge by eating smaller amts
	* Change thoughts that initiate a binge/purge
	* Identifying maladaptive thinking patterns & behavioral habits, then gradual practice of new habits
* Interpersonal therapy
### Binge Eating Disorder
* Previously-used medications for obesity not recommended
* CBT
	* Similar to that used for bulimia
	* Appears efficacious
* Interpersonal psychotherapy
	* Usually as effective as C BT
* Self-help techniques
	* Also appear effective
### Course & Outcome
* Anorexia: 51% remission, 21% partially recovered, 10% not recovered, 16% no longer alive after 21 yrs.
* Bulimia: 70% in remission after 11-12 yrs.
* Binge eating: 60% remission after 6 yrs.
