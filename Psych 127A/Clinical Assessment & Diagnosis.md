## Clinical Assessment
* *Systematic evaluation & measurement* of psychological, biological, & social factors in an individual presenting with a possible psychological disorder
* Many strategies to choose from, but no silver bullet approach
* Like putting together pieces of a puzzle
* Choose assessment approach based on
	* Referral question
	* Approaches to abnormal behavior (biological, behavior, cognitive, etc.)
	* Using multiple sources of information, improving reliability & validity
	* Whatever is most likely to yield useful info & recs
	* Realistic limitations
## Diagnosis
* Process of determining whether a particular problem *meets the criteria* for a disorder in a classification system (in the US, typically the DSM-5)
* Use info from clinical assessment to arrive at a diagnosis
* Diagnosis is only as good as assessment
## Reliability & Validity
### Reliability
* Degree to which an assessment tool is consistent
* **Inter-rater reliability** - do independent raters/judges agree, collect the same info, & reach the same conclusion
* **Test-retest reliability** - whether test results are stable over time, or similar results emerge with repeated administration
	* Depends on stability of construct itself
* **Inter-item reliability (internal consistency)** - whether items on the same test are correlated with each other
* **Split-half reliability** - whether both halves/parts of a test measure the same thing
### Validity
* Whether an assessment measures what it is actually supposed to measure
* Utility/meaningfulness
* **Face validity** - whether the test items subjectively seem to measure the target construct
	* e.g. Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)
		* I do not feel sad
		* I feel sad much of the time
		* I am sad all of the time
		* I am so sad or unhappy that I can't stand it
* **Concurrent validity** - whether tests that are designed to measure the same thing achieve the same result
	* e.g. BDI-II & CES-D (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale)
* **Predictive validity** - whether test accurately predicts future outcomes/behaviors
	* e.g. people w/ high scores will have greater functional impairment
### Usefulness & Consistency
* Reliability & validity are not all or none; there are degrees of usefulness & consistency

## Psychometrics
* Study of the theory & techniques of psychological measurement, inc. reliability & validity
* Dependent on the quality of research conducted & populations used
	* Language
	* Culture
	* Geographic location
	* Education
	* Age
### Local Validation
* Measures that are not locally contextualized and valid may result in substantial under/over-reporting on items
	* Idioms of distress, e.g. "I feel blue"
	* A study of Zulu-speaking participants in South Africa found that the PTSD section of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM disorders undercounted participants by almost 20% compared to a Zulu culture-specific trauma experience questionnaire
## Assessment Tools
* What info do we need?
* How should we get it?
* How will we know that the info is accurate, reliable, & valid?
* How should we take limitations like bias into account?
### Records Review
* Can provide critical background info, inc. on comorbid medical problems relevant to the referral question
* Usually incomplete & often unavailable
* Dependent upon the assessment of previous providers & consistency in entering record info
* Potential lack of validity/reliability
* Non-standardized
### Collateral Information
* Allows you to get reports from multiple people
* May increase reliability & validity of results
* **Self-report bias**
	* Social desirability bias
	* Recall bias
* Observers may have very limited info which is also biased by their own experiences, desire for approval, & recall
### Clinical Interview
* Most frequently used assessment technique
* Intensively interview client about their history, current symptoms & functioning in their own words
	* Relies on self-report, subject to related biases
* Includes an opportunity to observe non-verbal behaviors
* May be an **unstructured interview** or **semi-structured interview**
### Mental Status Exam
* Appearance & behavior
* Thought processes
* Mood & affect
* Intellectual functioning
* **Sensorium** - awareness of surroundings
	* Person
	* Place
	* Time
### Intelligence Assessment
* A person's ability to:
	* Receive info through various perceptual modalities
	* Retain info in memory
	* Organize it meaningfully through various cognitive processes
* Many theorists assumed that the individual differences displayed in these commonalities represent a **general ability**
* Others argue that intelligence is best conceptualized as several **separate abilities**, e.g. spatial & verbal abilities
### Neuropsychological Assessment
* Used to identify brain processes that may not be functioning optimally
	* Receptive & expressive language
	* Attention & concentration
	* Memory
	* Motor skills
	* Perceptual abilities
	* Learning
### Achievement Tests
* Standardized academic skills assessments which measure reading skills, math skills, spelling, & comprehension
* Used to assess current academic achievement, re-evaluation, & academic progress
### Symptom Checklists
* Self-report inventories to assess severity of symptoms of/impairment from a given disorder
* Vast num of symptom checklists, each with own psychometric props
* Some researched and used more frequently
* Assessor must select tools carefully based on reliability, validity, & ability to interpret results accurately
### Personality Inventories
* Measures of personal traits, e.g. Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)
* Intentionally less concerned with face validity
* Focused on predictive validity
	* People w/ certain disorders as a group respond more frequently to some items than to others
## Classification
### Classical Categorical Approach
* Every diagnosis has only one cause and does not overlap with any other disorder
* Since each disorder caused by a diff set of factors, there is only one set of defining criteria that everybody in the category has to meet
### Dimensional Approach
* All cognitions, moods, & behaviors of a person can be quantified on a scale
* Disagreement about how many dimensions are required, which are most important, and interpreting diff combinations
### Prototypical Approach
* Requires certain essential characteristics of a disorder, while allowing for non-essential characteristics
* Many possible features of disorder listed, with categorization contingent on meeting enough of them
* **Fuzzy categories** - blurring at the boundaries of categories, where some symptoms apply to more than one disorder
* Fits with current state of psychopathology, used in DSM-5 & ICD-11
### Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
* Published by the American Psychiatric Association
* **DSM-I (1952)** - psychosocial & psychoanalytic approach, emphasis on env & internal conflicts (106 disorders)
* **DSM-II (1968)** - similar approach to DSM-I
* 7th printing of DSM-II in 1974 removed homosexuality as a disorder
	* Protests by gay rights activists at the 1971 APA convention
	* Research by Alfred Kinsey & Evelyn Hooker disputed relation between homosexuality & mental disorders
* **DSM-III (1980)** - "all mental disorders are medical disorders"
	* Developed during anti-psychiatry movement, aiming to bring more medical credibility to psychiatry
	* Reduced emphasis on psychodynamic view, instead emphasizing observable symptoms
	* Goal was to improve uniformity & validity of psychiatric diagnosis and make nomenclature consistent with the ICD
	* 265 diagnoses
* **DSM III-R (1987)**
* **DSM-IV (1994)**
* **DSM-IV-TR (2000)** - text revision
* **DSM-5 (2013)** - developed for close to a decade
* **DSM-5-TR (2022)** - 298 disorders
### Problems with Reliability
* Problems with understanding & agreeing upon essential features of a diagnosis
* Clinicians often rely on incomplete info
	* Single assessment
	* Unidimensional assessment
### Within Category Heterogeneity
* Individuals may only have some features of a disorder but still meet criteria if those symptoms are central to the prototype
* Vast array of symptoms that are all thought to reflect hallmark features of a single diagnosis, e.g. lethargy/fatigue, poor concentration
* Two or more clients with same disorder can look very different
### Comorbidity
* Rule rather than the exception
* National comorbidity study (1990s-200s) found substance-related disorders, personality disorders, depression, anxiety to be most highly comorbid
* May signal problems w/ classification system
* Could be a function of same underlying personality characteristics/temperament
### NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)
* Integrates many levels of info e.g. genomics, circuits, behavior, self-report
* Goal is to understand the nature of mental health & illness in terms of varying degrees of dysfunction in general psychological/biological systems
