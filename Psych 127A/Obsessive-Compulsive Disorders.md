## OCD
### Obsessions
* Recurrent, persistent, thoughts, urges, or images
	* Distressing
	* Instrusive
	* Highly individualized
	* Irrational 
	* Uncontrollable
	* Unwarranted
	* Unwanted
	* Arise from within
	* Interfere w/ everyday life
* May be especially distressing if incongruent w/ values/beliefs
* Sense that obsessions must be subjectively resisted, ignored, suppressed, dealt with, neutralized with some other thought/action (i.e. performing a compulsion)
#### Common Obsessions
* Contamination: concerns/disgust w/ dirt/germs
* Aggressive: fear might harm others
* Religious/scrupulosity obsessions
* Worries about doing the right thing
### Compulsions
* Repetitive behaviors that person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession/according to rules that must be applied rigidly
* Behaviors/mental acts aimed at preventing/reducing anxiety/distress or preventing some dreaded event/situation
* Not connected in a realistic way w/ what they are designed to neutralize/prevent or are clearly excessive
#### Common Compulsions
* Cleaning: washing, showering
* Checking: locks, stove, didn't harm others, safety/reassurance seeking, didn't make a mistake/miss a word when reading
* Repeating routine activities: combing hair, going in/out of doorway, doing things specific # of times
* Doing things "the right way"
### Statistics
* Approx. 30% people report having an obsession/compulsion during their lifetime
* 2% lifetime prevalence OCD, 1% 12 mo. prevalence
* Overall same lifetime prevalence by gender
* Suicide considered at some point by approx. half of those w/ OCD
* 90% people w/ OCD have another mental disorder (76% anxiety, 63% mood disorder)
### Vulnerabilities & Treatment
#### Biological Factors
* Some heritable component: rate of OCD among 1st degree relatives 2x that of those w/o OCD
* Basal ganglia facilitates wanted behaviors/thoughts and stops unwanted behaviors/thoughts
* OCD symptoms can be improved by stimulating parts of the basal ganglia
####  Medication
* Clomipramine - tricyclic that blocks reuptake of norepinephrine
* SSRIs
* Medications benefit up to 60% of patients
* Relapse is common w/ medication discontinuation
#### Psychological Explanations
* Conditioning
	* Not checking paired with something bad happened
	* Checking seen as way to ward off bad things from happening
* Cognitive biases toward danger/threat schemas
* Magical thinking: believing one event happens as a result of another w/o plausible link of causation
* **Thought Action Fusion (TAF)** - belief that simply having a thought about an event makes that event more likely to occur
#### CBT
* Exposure & response prevention is most effective treatment for OCD
* Repeated exposure to negative, unwanted thoughts paired w/ response prevention
	* Recognize that thoughts are separate from actions
	* Find new, adaptive ways of relieving anxiety
	* Extinguish anxiety response over time
* Gradual exposures for a variety of triggers:
	* Obsessions
	* Social situations
	* Phobias: darkness, insects, snakes, etc.
	* Exposure to bodily sensations
## OCD Spectrum Disorders
### Body Dysmorphic Disorder
* Preoccupation w/ imagined defect in appearance
* Excessive concern if slight anomaly present
* Repetitive behaviors/mental acts in response to appearance concerns
	* e.g. mirror checking, comparing his/her appearance w/ that of others
### Hoarding Disorder
* Previously considered OCD subtype
* Most individuals who show hoarding behavior do not endorse other OCD symptoms
* Persistent difficulty discarding/parting w/ possessions, regardless of their actual value
* Difficulty due to perceived need to save the items, distress assoc'd w/ discarding them
### Trichotillomania & Excoriation
* Trichotillomania - urge to pull out one's own hair from anywhere on the body
* Excoriation - repetitive & compulsive picking of the skin, leading to tissue damage
* Behavioral habit reversal treatment is most effective
	* Awareness straining used to bring greater attention to behavior
	* Develop a competing response to replace the behavior
	* Incr. motivation: make list of problems caused by behavior
	* Practice new skills in different contexts
