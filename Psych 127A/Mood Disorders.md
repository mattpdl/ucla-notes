## Mood
* **Affective** - how person presents mood
	* e.g. brooding, sad, flat, elevated, withdrawn, etc.
* **Cognitive** - how person thinks
	* e.g. loss of interest, delusions, inability to concentrate, thoughts of suicide, pressured thoughts, poor judgment
* **Behavioral** - what person does
	* e.g. low energy, psychomotor agitation/retardation, irritability, agitation, crying spells, lots of/no sleep, changes in eating habits, overactivity
* **Physiological** - how body functions
	* e.g. appetite changes, constipation, sleep disturbance, menstrual cycle disruption, changes in sex drive
### Mood Disorders
* Disturbances in emotions that cause subjective discomfort and/or hinder a person's ability to function
* Negative and/or positive affectivity
* Historically viewed as two different poles (hence, "bipolar")
	* Depressive disorders and bipolar disorders now seen as distinct from one another and are in different categories
## Depressive Disorders
* Major depressive disorder
* Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)
* Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
* Premenstrual dysphoric disorder
* Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder
* Depressive disorder due to another medical condition
* Common features among all:
	* Sad/empty/irritable mood
	* Somatic changes
	* Cognitive changes
* Diffs btwn disorders due to duration/timing/presumed etiology
### Major Depressive Disorder
* >= 1 major depressive episode
	* Bereavement exclusion eliminated from the DSM-5
* DSM-5 criteria:
	* >= 5 symptoms present during same 2 wk period
	* Represent a change from prev func'ing
	* >= 1 symptoms is either depressed mood/loss of interest in pleasure
#### Symptoms
* Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day
* Markedly diminished interest/pleasure in almost/all activities most of the day, nearly every day
* Significant weight loss when not dieting/weight gain or decrease/increase in appetite nearly every day
* Insomnia/hypersomnia nearly every day
* Psychomotor agitation/retardation nearly everyday (observable by others), not merely subjective feelings of restlessness/being slowed down
* Fatigue/loss of energy nearly every day
* Feelings of worthlessness or excessive/inappropriate guilt
* Diminished ability to think/concentrate or indecisiveness nearly every day
* Recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt/specific plan
#### Remission/Recurrence
* Majority of those who experience depression will experience resolution/remission w/in 12 mo.
* Recurrence is the norm
* 50% people who have had one episode will have another one
* 80% people w/ a history of two episodes will have another
* Recurrent episodes usually begin w/in 5 yrs of initial episode
* On avg, people w/ history of depression will have 5-9 recurrences in their lifetime
* Women more likely to have recurrence
### Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymic Disorder)
* Chronic, mild depression
* Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day
* Only >= 2 symptoms to meet criteria
* Must have suffered with the depressed mood for more days than not for at least two years
### Statistics
* Most common of psychological disorders
* According to WHO (2016), depression accounts for 10% of total disease burden worldwide
* Worldwide lifetime prevalence is 16% for major depression, 6% in the last year
* Women twice as likely to have major depression
* Women account for 7/10 cases of major depressive disorder
### Gender Differences in Expression
* Cognitive Vulnerability-Stress Model:
	* Higher levels of negative cognitive style in girls than boys beginning in early adolescence
	* Higher levels of stress/negative life events for girls than boys beginning in early adolescence
* Biological factors model:
	* Girls who go through puberty early may be more at risk of depression because of several processes, such as early-puberty girls encountering more peer sexual harassment than boys and on-time girls
	* Pubertal maturation may sensitize females to the depressogenic effects of negative life events
## Models
### Biological Model
#### Heritability
* 30-40% heritable
* Family studies:
	* Rate is high in relatives of people w/ depression
	* Relatives of people w/ bipolar disorder more likely to have unipolar depression
* Twin studies:
	* Concordance rates high in identical twins
		* 2-3x more likely to present with mood disorders than a fraternal twin of a depressed cotwin
	* Severe mood disorders have strong genetic contribution
	* Heritability rates higher for females compared to males
	* Vulnerability for uni/bipolar disorder appears to be inherited separately
	* Some genetic factors are common for mood & anxiety disorders
* Heritability may be partly accounted for by trait-neuroticism
#### Genetics
* Individuals with 1/2 copies of 5-HTTLPR experience higher levels of depression & suicidality following life stressor
* Stress-Reactivity
	* Extent to which the amygdala is activated by negative stimuli also associated with 5-HTTLPR genotypes
	* Biological reactivity to environmental input/stress
#### Brain Differences
* Asymmetry btwn left & right activity in prefrontal cortex
	* Lower left activity leads to less approach & less positive affect
	* Higher right activity leads to more negative affect & increased vigilance for threat
* Decreased hippocampal volume
	* May be related to overproduction of stress hormones like cortisol
* Amygdala shows increased activation
	* Processing of memory, decision-making, & emotional responses (e.g. fear, anxiety, depression)
#### Hormones
* Elevated cortisol levels & abnormal daily rhythms of cortisol level observed in some cases of depression
* Stress hormones decrease neurogenesis in the hippocampus => less able to make new neurons
#### Monoamine Theory of Depression
* Depression due to lack of neurotransmitters from the monoamine class
	* Serotonin
	* Dopamine
	* Norepinephrine
* Medications for depression target monoamine neurotransmitters
* Monoamine neurotransmitters do not appear to be disrupted in all people with depression
	* Other neurotransmitters also play a role
* Neurotransmitters likely interact w/ hormones to increase risk for depression
### Cognitive Model
#### Learned Helplessness
* Lack of perceived control over life events leads to decreased attempts to improve own situation
* Negative cognitive styles are a risk factor for depression
#### Depressive Attributional Style
* **Internal attributions** - negative outcomes are one's own fault
* **Stable attributions** - believing future negative outcomes will be one's fault
* **Global attribution** - believing negative events will disrupt many life activities
* All three domains contribute to a sense of hopelessness
#### Cognitive Triad
* Negative beliefs about self, the world, and the future increase risk for & maintain depression
#### Schemas
* Organized representations of prior experiences, including views of self, ability to manage and succeed in the world
* Learned in childhood, shaped over time
* Constructs include:
	* Self-image
	* Self-esteem
	* Cognitive errors
	* Expectations for others and the future
* Beliefs (schemas) influence perception
* "It is not a situation in and of itself that determines what people feel, but rather the way in which they construe that situation" that determines mood (Beck, 1964)
* Diathesis-Stress Model: schemas are a vulnerability, dormant until a stressor presents
#### Cognitive Distortions
* Selective abstraction - drawing conclusions on the basis of just one of many elements of a situation
* Minimization - downplaying the importance of a positive thought/emotion/event
* Personalization - attributing responsibility for events which aren't under a person's control
* Arbitrary inference - drawing conclusions when there is little or no evidence
* Magnification - blowing things out of proportion
* Overgeneralization - making sweeping conclusions based on a single event
#### Automatic Thoughts
* Negative cognitive triad & depressed schemas combine to create automatic negative thoughts & illogical thinking
* Automatic
* Distorted
* Unhelpful
* Plausible
* Involuntary
### Behavioral Model
* "The person in the situation" - sense of self as entirely constructed by the individual & his/her env
* Focus on learning & reinforcement
* Depression is a func of low rate of pos. reinforcement
	* In the absence of reinforcement, pos. behaviors likely to elicit such reinforcement eventually become extinguished
	* Leads to a pattern of depressogenic behaviors like not engaging in social activities
	* Individual does not engage in behaviors that are likely to make him/her happy
* Depressive behaviors are reinforced by the environment, thus perpetuating these behaviors
### Interpersonal Model
* Relationships buffer against depression
	* Extent of social support is related to depression
	* Lack of social support predicts late onset depression
	* Substantial social support predicts recovery from depression
* Depression linked to relationship distress
	* Low expression of pos. affect (PA), high expression of neg. affect (NA)
	* Reassurance seeking
	* Reinforcement of dysphoric affect
	* Lack of shared positive activities
* Strong relationships enhance likelihood of treatment success for depression
## Treatments
### Antidepressant Medications
* Work by increasing availability of the monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain
	* Blocking reuptake or inhibiting metabolism by enzymes
* **Tricyclic antidepressants** - block the process of reuptake of monoamines
	* Negative side effects common
	* May be lethal in large doses
* **Monoamine oxidase inhibitors** - inhibits the activity of the MAO enzyme, thus limiting breakdown of monoamines which increases their availability in the brain
	* Dangerous in combination w/ certain foods
* **Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors** - inhibit reuptake of serotonin
* **Mixed reuptake inhibitors** - e.g. serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors
* Approx. equally effective
	* Only 50% patients benefit
	* Only 25% achieve normal func'ing
### Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)
* Effective for medication-resistant depression
* Brief electrical current applied to the brain under general anesthesia
* Usually 6-10 outpatient treatments required
* Side effects:
	* Temporary seizures
	* Short-term memory loss, which is usually restored
	* Some patients suffer long-term memory loss
* Mechanism unclear
### Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
* Uses magnets to generate a precise localized electromagnetic pulse
* Few side effects - occasional headaches
* Less effective than ECT for medication-resistant depression
* May be combined with medication
### Psychotherapy
* Cognitive-behavioral therapy
	* Addresses cognitive errors in thinking
	* Behavioral change
* Interpersonal psychotherapy
	* Focus: improving problematic relationships
* Has longer-lasting effectiveness than medication
### Behavioral Activation
* Goal: increase activity & access to reinforcement through overt behavior change
* Assessment of contingencies that maintain depressive behavior & targeting of behavioral changes that will improve quality of life
* Focus on behavioral goals regardless of aversive thoughts & mood states
* Scheduling of activities (behavioral technique) - increase time for social activities as a way to facilitate pleasurable activities & enhance positive emotions
### Medication vs. Psychotherapy
* Psychotherapy
	* Pro: Research evidence, support of therapist, discussion of other concerns, less relapse
	* Con: Slow, 50-60% response rates
* Pharmacotherapy
	* Pro: Research evidence, faster acting than psychotherapy
	* Con: Side effects, dependence
## Bipolar & Related Disorders
* Bipolar I
* Bipolar II
* Cyclothymic disorder
* **Mood episodes** - extreme & intense emotional states that occur at distinct times
	* Categorized as manic/hypomanic/depressive
* People w/ bipolar disorders generally have periods of normal mood as well
### Statistics
* 2-4% prevalence for bipolar I & II
* 3x as many depressed days as manic/hypomanic days
* Bipolar disorders approx. equally affect males & females
	* Women more likely to experience rapid cycling & to be in depressive period
### Dimensions of Mania
* **Dysphoria** - guilt, lability, anxiety, suicidal thoughts/gestures
* **Psychomotor acceleration** - thoughts, speech, motor activity
* **Psychosis** - grandiosity, delusions, paranoia
* Increased hedonic tone - euphoric mood, pleasure seeking
* Irritability/aggression
### Manic Episode
* Distinct period of abnormally & persistently elevated, expansive, irritable mood, lasting >= 1 week (or less w/ hospitalization)
* During period of mood disturbance, >= 3:
	* Inflated self-esteem, grandiosity
	* Decreased need for sleep
	* More talkative than usual, pressured speech
	* Flight of ideas, racing thoughts
	* Distractibility
	* Increase in goal-directed activity/psychomotor agitation
	* Excessive involvement in pleasure activities that have high potential for painful consequences
* Symptoms not better explained by mixed episode
* Impairment in functioning (or else psychotic features)
* Symptoms not due to substances
### Lithium
* Lithium carbonate - treatment of choice for bipolar disorder
* Effective w/in 2-3 weeks
* Considered a mood stabilizer b/c it treats depressive & manic symptoms
* Toxic in large amounts - dose must be carefully monitored
* Effective for 50% patients
* Mechanism unclear - interacts w/ a number of neurotransmitters & receptors, dec'ing norepinephrine release & inc'ing serotonin synthesis
### Psychosocial Treatments
* Medication still first line of defense
* Psychotherapy helpful in managing interpersonal, occupational problems that accompany bipolar disorder
* Family therapy can be helpful
### Interpersonal & Social Rhythm Therapy
* Recurrence vulnerability appears to occur via three main pathways:
	* Non-adherence to medication
	* Presence of a stressful live event
	* Disruptions in social rhythms
* Prevents recurrence of mood episodes by regulating patients' daily routines (specifically, often erratic sleep/wake cycles, meal times, & times of rest vs. activity)
* Simultaneously improving quality of interpersonal relationships and performance of key social roles
### Family-Focused Therapy (FFT)
* Given in conjunction w/ pharmacotherapy after an illness episode
* Conjoint sessions of:
	* Psychoeducation regarding bipolar illness
	* Communication enhancement training
	* Problem-solving skills training
* Effects of FFT are greater among patients with high-expressed emotion relatives
	* Critical comments
	* Evidence of hostility
	* Emotional overinvolvement
		* Self-sacrificing
		* Overconcerned/overprotective
		* Exaggerated emotional responses to, or unclear boundaries w/ patientw
