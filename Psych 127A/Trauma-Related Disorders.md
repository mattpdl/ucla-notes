## Trauma
* DSM-III formulation: **traumatic events** conceptualized as catastrophic stressors outside of the range of usual human experience
	* DSM framers had in mind traumatic events related to war & natural disasters
* DSM-IV: traumatic events characterized by a threat & interpretation/experience of the event with fear, helplessness, horror
* DSM-5: traumatic events involve actual/threatened death/serious injury/sexual violence e.g. rape, combat, bombings, accidents, natural disasters
	* Exposure can be in/direct via direct experience/witnessing/learning through a relative/friend
### Prevalence
* 61% men, 51% women experience trauma in their lifetime
* Women more likely to experience sexual assault & child sexual abuse
* Men more likely to experience accidents, physical assault, combat, disaster, death/injury
### Adverse Childhood Events (ACEs)
* Cumulative adversity/toxic stress
* 61% adults experienced >= 1 type of ACE
* 1/6 reported experiencing >= 4 types of ACEs
* Linked to chronic health problems, mental illness, & substance abuse in adulthood
* ACEs can negatively impact education, job opportunities, & earning potential
### Integrated Model of Dimensions of Environmental Experience
* **Threat-based forms of harshness**: morbidity-mortality from harm imposed by other agents
	* Number of different types of violence a child encounters/overall freq of violence exposure
	* Direct victimization e.g. physical abuse
	* Witnessed e.g. violence btwn caregivers
* **Deprivation-based forms of harshness**: morbidity-mortality from insufficient environmental inputs
	* Limited/reduced social & cognitive inputs from env during development e.g. neglect, institutional rearing, parental absence, poverty
	* May consider separate dimensions of cognitive, material, & emotional deprivation
* Environmental unpredictability
* Some developmental pathways, e.g. development of particular brain circuits, but not others, are uniquely influenced by particular dimensions of early experience
## Social Determinants of Health
* Variety of factors affect groups disparately due to unequal distributions of money, power, & other resources and influence health & access to health care
* Racism
* Ethnocentricity
* Socioeconomic marginalization
* Patterned poverty
### Disproportionate Cumulative Trauma & Impact
* Higher prevalence of adverse events in individuals who are:
	* Racially marginalized
	* High school non-graduates
	* Unemployed/unable to work
	* Low income
	* Uninsured/underinsured
	* Incarcerated/involved in justice system
	* Women
	* LGBT
### Discrimination, Microaggressions, Minority Stress
* **Minority stressors & microagressions** - acts of racism, discrimination, bullying, victimization, daily harassments
	* Can be chronic
	* May be subtle rather than overt
* **Distal stressors** - external events directed toward the minority individual implicitly/explicitly due to minority status
	* e.g. workplace harassment, discrimination, physical/sexual violence
* **Proximal stressors** - internal in nature, include the anticipation & expectation of future negative events, continue in absence of identifiable threat
	* e.g. internalized neg. beliefs about self/group, hypervigilance/concealment
	* May develop in response to experiencing/anticipating distal stressors
	* Protective & necessary while still psychologically harmful
### Racial Trauma
* Race-related dangerous events & experiences of racial discrimination
* May include threats of harm & injury, humiliating & shaming events, witnessing racial discrimination
* Involves ongoing individual & collective injuries due to re/exposure to race-based stress
* Also includes reactions of BIPOC individuals to experiences of racial traumatic events e.g. stress, distress, & other poor physical & mental health outcomes
### Historical Trauma
* Intergenerationally-transferred human consequences of cultural oppression of a population through colonization/slavery/genocide
* Long-term impact of colonization, cultural suppression, & historical oppression of many indigenous peoples
* Includes cumulative effects & cross-generational impacts of subjugation, oppression, & marginalization of communities
* Takes into account not only past trauma but ongoing structural violence
### Cultural Trauma
* Familial/historical/sociopolitical accounts of discrimination/ethnoviolence in one's communities
	* Watching news accounts of violence on TV can contribute to traumatization
* PTSD prevalence in certain groups may be faciliated by core beliefs about the lack of benevolence in the world due to historic/experienced/witnessed exposure to racism & discrimination
### Resilience
* Duration of adversity
* No. of adversities & interactions btwn them
* Type of adversity
* Developmental status & critical period timing
	* Childhood
	* Adolescence
	* Adulthood
## Trauma & Stressor-Related Disorders
* New classification in DSM-5
	* Previously PTSD listed w/ anxiety disorders
	* Grouped together b/c of shared origin: stressful life events
* **Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**
* **Acute stress disorder** - PTSD symptoms up to one month after trauma
* **Adjustment disorders** - depressed mood, anxiety, conduct, "disturbance of emotion"
* Reactive attachment disorder
* Disinhibited social engagement disorder
### Attachment Disorders
* Occurs as a result of inadequate/neglectful care in early childhood
* Disturbed & developmentally inappropriate behaviors in children
* Child unable/unwilling to form normal attachment relationships w/ caregiving adults
* Experienced social neglect/deprivation, repeated changes in primary caregivers, institutional care w/ high child-to-adult ratio
* **Reactive attachment disorder** (9 mo. - 5 yr.)
	* Abnormally withdrawn & inhibited behavior
	* Less receptive to support from caregivers
* **Disinhibited social engagement disorder** (9 mo. - adolescence)
	* Pattern of abnormally low inhibition in children
	* e.g. approaching unfamiliar adults w/o fear
### Adjustment Disorders
* Anxious/depressive reactions to an identifiable stressor that develop w/in 3 mo. of the stressor
	* e.g. moving, job loss, divorce, etc.
* Clinically significant distress/impairment
	* Depressed mood, anxiety, mixed mood & anxiety, conduct
* Once the stressor/its consequences terminate, symptoms don't persist for > 6 mo.
	* May become persistent in another disorder
### PTSD
* **Acute PTSD** - may be diagnosed 1-3 mo. post trauma, after which acute stress disorder would develop
* **Chronic PTSD** - diagnosed > 3 mo. post trauma
* **Delayed onset PTSD** - onset > 6 mo. post trauma
#### Symptoms
* Intrusive recurrent & involuntary re-experiencing of the event
	* Emotionally intense memories
	* Nightmares
	* Flashbacks in which the individual feels/acts as if the traumatic event were recurring
	* Psychological/physiological distress at exposure to internal/external reminders of the traumatic event
* Heightened arousal/reactivity
	* Irritable/aggressive behavior
	* Reckless/self-destructive behavior
	* Hypervigilance
	* Exaggerated startle response
	* Problems w/ concentration
	* Sleep disturbance
* Persistent avoidance of:
	* **Internal reminders**: distressing memories/thoughts/feelings/physical sensations assoc'd w/ traumatic event
	* **External reminders**: people, places, conversations, activities, objs, situations assoc'd w/ trauma
* Persistent & exaggerated negative mood/thoughts
	* *Symptoms comprise **Complex PTSD** in the ICT
	* Negative beliefs/expectations about oneself/others/the world e.g. "no one can be trusted", "I've lost my soul", "the world is dangerous"
	* Distorted cognitions about the cause/consequences of the traumatic event, leading to blame on oneself/others
	* Negative emotional state e.g. fear, horror, anger, guilt, shame
	* Markedly diminished interest/participation in significant activities
	* Detachment/estrangement from others
	* Restricted range of affect
	* Sense of foreshortened future
	* Inability to remember important aspects of traumatic event *(typically dissociative amnesia, not due to head injury/alcohol/drugs)*
#### DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria
* Symptoms in all four categories last longer than 1 mo.
* Significant symptom-related psychological/physiological distress/functional impairment
#### Prevalence
* Approx. 7% experience PTSD at some point
* Approx. 10% develop PTSD after a traumatic event
* Predictors of trajectories
	* Socioeconomic disadvantage
	* More extensive trauma history
	* Fewer social resources
* Sizeable proportion of urban trauma survivors experience chronic subthreshold PTSD
## Vulnerabilities
### Genetic
* **Serotonin transporter short/short gene variant** - incr'd prob. of developing a stress disorder
### Brain
* Smaller hippocampal volume in individuals w/ war-related PTSD & some adult survivors of childhood abuse
* Studies suggest smaller hippocampal volume existed prior to trauma and may be a vulnerability factor
* Other studies suggest stress & trauma negatively impact hippocampal volume
### Hormonal Abnormalities
* HPA axis - connection between hypothalamus, pituitary, & adrenal glands
	* Hypothalamus signals pituitary to signal the adrenal gland to release epinephrine for arousal & cortisol for stress
	* Prepares body for fight/flight
	* Chronic stress creates excess cortisol
		* Inhibits innate immune response (stress-induced immunosuppression)
		* Body is in escape mode rather than healing mode
		* Too much cortisol can damage brain cells
	* Stress response over-/under-reactivity
### Psychological/Individual
* Higher risk
	* Higher levels of neuroticism
	* Pre-existing anxiety & depression
	* Exposure to previous trauma
	* Membership in a minority group
	* Negative/unsupportive social environments
* Lower risk
	* Higher socioeconomic status (SES) & education
	* Higher pre-trauma cognitive abilities
* Combat-related trauma
	* Justification for trauma
	* Identification w/ combat unit
## Treatment
### Remission
* Approx. 50% people w/ PTSD recover w/o treatment w/in 3 yrs of diagnosis
* PTSD may result as a disruption of natural recovery process
### Medication
* Not effective on most PTSD symptoms
* May be effective against comorbid depression, anxiety, & sleep symptoms
* Most common: SSRIs & sleep medications
### CBT
* Effective
* Psychoeducation, relaxation/breathing, coping
* Exposure
	* **In vivo exposure** to avoided places, people, & situations
	* **Imaginal exposure** - developing a narrative of traumatic event to process event and challenge inaccurate & negative thoughts
	* Challenge maladaptive beliefs about the world & self
