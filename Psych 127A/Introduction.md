## Problematic behavior
### Elements
* **Impairment** - reduction in cognitive, emotional, or behavioral functioning
* Suffering/distress
* Poor control/dysregulation
* Irrationality/unpredictability
* Dangerousness
* Violation of societal standards
* Neuropsychological/biological dysfunction/diff
* Statistically rare *and* undesirable
* *No one element is sufficient*

### What Makes Behavior, Thoughts, and Emotions Problematic?
* Definition changes as society and context changes
	* Not culturally expected
* Context
	* Atypical for a person's age
		* Developmentally appropriate (toddler tantrums)
	* Biological changes e.g. puberty, menopause
	* Atypical within a spiritual/religious context
* Culture
	* Superstitions
	* Expressions of distress (somatic symptoms)
	* What is considered distressing

## DSM-5 Psychological Disorders
* **Mental disorder** - a syndrome characterized by *clinically significant disturbance* in an individual's cognition, emotion, regulation, or behavior
	* Reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning
	* Associated with significant distress/disability in social, occupational, or other important activities
* Non-examples of mental disorders
	* Expectable/culturally approved response to a common stressor/loss
	* **Socially deviate behavior** (e.g. political, religious, sexual) and conflicts primarily between individuals and society, unless the deviance/conflict results from an individual dysfunction
* **Prototypes** - "typical" profile of a disorder in which most/all symptoms that experts agree are part of the disorder are present
	* Diagnostic criteria from DSM-5 are prototypes
	* If a certain number of symptoms expected for the disorder are present, the person is considered to have the disorder
	* Dimensions of symptoms (e.g. mild to severe intensity/freq)

## Clinical Psychological Science
* Branch of psychology that studies potentially problematic patterns of behavior, emotion, or thoughts which may/not be related to a mental disorder
* **Psychopathology** - study of mental disorders
* Clinical psychologists are scientist-practitioners that are consumers, evaluators, and creators of science
* Studying psychological disorders focuses on:
	* Clinical description
	* Causation (etiology)
	* Treatment & outcome
* **Presenting problem** - difficulties a person has
* **Clinical description** - unique combo of behaviors, thoughts, and feelings that make up a specific disorder
* **Course** - pattern that a disorder follows (e.g. chronic, remitting)
* **Prognosis** - anticipated course of a disorder, with/out treatment
* **Etiology** - study of origins, why a disorder begins
* **Multidimensional integrative approach** - behavior is the product of continual interaction of psychological, biological, and social influences
	* Reciprocal influence among neuroscience, cognitive science, behavior science, and developmental science
