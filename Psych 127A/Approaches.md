## How Disorders Develop
* **Etiology** - study of origins, cause of a disorder
	* Biological
	* Psychological
	* Social
* **Equifinality** - a behavior/disorder may have several causes
	* e.g. two people with depression may have different experiences, genetics, personalities, etc.
* **Multifinality** - a particular history may result in different outcomes
	* e.g. two people who experienced the same traumatic event have very different outcomes
### Multidimensional Integrative Approach
* Psychological disorders are the product of multiple interacting causal factors
	* Biological
	* Behavioral
	* Cognitive
	* Emotional
	* Social
	* Developmental
* Each component influences the others
### Diathesis-Stress Model
* **Diathesis** (biological/psychological vulnerability) & stress (env factors) interact and lead to distress/dysfunction
* Distress/dysfunction can lead to a psychological disorder
## Biological Factors
* Genetic vulnerabilities
* Neurotransmitters
* Hormones
* Brain dysfunction
### Genetic Vulnerabilities
* Few disorders caused by a single gene
* Most disorders are **polygenic** or influenced by many genes
* Every gene influenced by env
### Gene-Environment Interactions and Correlations
* **Range of reaction**
	* Genes set boundaries and env determines where one falls on that continuum
	* e.g. person with tall parents will prob be tall, but actual height influenced by nutrition & other env factors
* **Genetic environmental correlation**
	* e.g. child of professional soccer players likely to have high genetic potential *and* more likely to be exposed to soccer at an early age
		* parents' genes -> child's env, allowing child to reach full potential
	* e.g. anxious parents 
		* anxious parents -> child w/ genes more susceptible to anxiety
		* anxious parents -> raise child in a overly-protective env that promotes anxiety
### Epigenetics
* Only a small proportion of genes in a cell are expressed
* Env factors (inc. social & cultural factors) influence whether genes are turned on
	* e.g. early maternal deprivation can prevent genetic expression of receptors that modulate stress hormones
* People with different genotypes may be differentially sensitive to their envs
* Epigenetic changes *can be inherited* as part of the **epigenome**
* Because the genome itself does not change, the epigenome fades as env improves
### Nervous System
* **Central nervous system**
	* Brain
	* Spinal cord
	* Retina
* **Autonomic nervous system**
	* Neurons (nerves) that connect the CNS to organs
### Neurons
* Soma - cell body
* Dendrites - receive messages from other cells
* Axon - passes messages away from cell body to other neurons, muscles, glands
* Action potential - electrical signal traveling down the axon
* Myelin sheath - covers the axon of some neurons and helps speed neural impulses
* Terminal buttons - form junctions with other cells
### Neurotransmitters
* **Monoamine neurotransmitters**
	* Serotonin - 5-hyrdoxytryptamine (5HT)
	* Dopamine
	* Norepinephrine (noadrenaline)
		* Complex interactions
		* Implicated in disorders e.g. depression, anxiety, substance misuse, psychotic disorders
* **Amino acid neurotransmitters**
	* Gamma-aminobutryic acid (GABA) - inhibitory (turns off neurons), reduces arousal, minor tranquilizer
	* Glutamate - excitatory (turns on neurons)
* Chemical imbalance - too little/much
* Overly simplistic
	* Receptor sites may be over/under-responsive
	* Multiple neurotransmitters involved
### Human Brain Anatomy
* Cerebellum - muscle movements, balance, equilibrium
* Occipital lobe - vision
* Parietal lobe - obj id, spatial relationships, pain, touch, spoken lang
* Temporal lobe - short-term memory, speech, musical rhythm, smell
* Frontal lobe - personality, decision-making, movement, speech, "thoughts"
* Limbic system - fear, anger, sexual activity
### Autonomic Nervous System
* Regulates cardiovascular & endocrine systems
* **Sympathetic nervous system**
	* Mobilizes body in times of stress
	* Rapidly activates organs & glands
	* Increased heart rate, respiration, oxygen flow
* **Parasympathetic nervous system**
	* Downregulates the sympathetic nervous system
	* Normalizes arousal
	* Facilitates digestion
### Hormones
* **Endocrine system** produces hormones
* Endocrine regulation plays a role in several psychological disorders e.g. depression, anxiety, schizophrenia
	* Adrenal gland produces epinephrine (adrenaline) in response to stress
	* Thyroid produces thyroxine that facilitates energy, metabolism, & growth
	* Pituitary gland produces many regulatory hormones
	* Gonadal glands produces estrogen & testosterone
* Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenocortical (HPA) Axis
	* Connection between hypothalmus, pituitary, & adrenal glands
	* Hypothalamus signals pituitary to signal the adrenal gland to release epinephrine for arousal & cortisol for stress
	* HPA axis implicated in several psychological disorders
### Brain Dysfunction
* Brain lesions & defects in brain tissue can result in psychiatric disorders
	* Traumatic brain injury associated with depression
* Neural plasticity in making changes in organization/function in response to env & life experiences
	* Positive results in context of early brain injury (prenatally) if child is in enriched env
## Developmental Model
### Developmental Psychopathology
* Development of psychological disorders from a life course perspective
* **Psychopathology** can be understood as "normal development gone awry" i.e. typical vs atypical trajectories in the developing brain
* Physiological, genetic, social, cognitive, emotional, & cultural factors influence the longitudinal trajectory of psychological well-being
* Experiences during different developmental periods have differential effects on vulnerability to psychological disorders
	* Adults exposed to child maltreatment during early childhood (age <= 5) had depression & PTSD symptoms up to 2x high as those exposed in later childhood & adolescence
	* Adults exposed in middle childhood (age 6-10) to other interpersonal violence had depressive symptoms 2x high as those first exposed in adulthood
### Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory
* Development occurs within nested contexts
* **Macrosystem** - attitudes & ideologies of the culture
* **Exosystem** - neighbors, social services, industry,  local politics, mass media
* **Mesosystem** - interaction btwn internal & external influences
* **Microsystem** - family, school, peers, health services, church
* **Individual** - sex, age, health, etc.
### Temperament
* Reactivity & characteristic self-regulation
* Early temperament thought to be the basis form which personality develops
* 5 dimensions
	* Fearfulness
	* Irritability & frustration
	* Positive affect
	* Activity level
	* Attentional persistence & effortful control
* Genetic influence: identical twins more alike in temperament than fraternal twins
* Temperament moderately stable through infancy, childhood, & adolescence
* Fearful preschoolers tend to be inhibited as older children & adolescents
	* Inhibited children more likely to be introverted adults
### Attachment & Parenting
* Insecure & maladaptive parent-child attachment (early relationships) create anxiety, low self-esteem, & guilt
* **Attachment theory** (John Bowlby) - infants attach to sensitive & responsive care caregivers from 6 mo - 2 yrs, forming the prototype/working model for future relationships
* "The Strange Situation" (Mary Ainsworth) - attachment styles
* Harry Harlow's studies: caregiver deprivation can lead to self-harm, rocking, extreme anxiety & depression
## Behavioral Perspective
### Classical Conditioning
* Learned associations occur when a neutral stimulus repeatedly paired with a conditioned stimulus
* Little Albert (John Watson): paired banging of a hammer with the visual stimulus of a white rat -> Baby Albert developed an aversion to soft white stimuli
* e.g. PTSD & triggers
### Operant (Instrumental) Conditioning
* Reinforced behavior tends to be repeated
* Unreinforced behavior tends to die out or be extinguished
* Skinner Box: shaped rat's behavior with a lever determining when food would be dispensed (*positive reinforcement*), as well as whether an electrical shock would be administered (*negative reinforcement*)
* e.g. substance abuse
### Learned Helplessness
* Martin Seligman: passivity/inability/unwillingness to escape thought to be due to acquiring learned helplessness
* Recent research found that passivity is the default state, but organisms learn that they can act and change their situations
* **Self-efficacy** - belief in one's own ability to achieve their goals
* **Learned helplessness theory**: lack of control -> low self-efficacy -> depression
	* Depression & other mental disorders due to real/perceived absence of control over one's circumstances/env
### Observational (Social) Learning
* People learn from others & what is around them
	* Bobo Dolls experiment (Bandura): kids mirrored adults' behavior
* Involves self-efficacy & motivation
* More likely to emulate people perceived as:
	* Similar
	* Rewarded for the behavior
	* Admired/of higher social status
## Cognitive Model
* How event/situation perceived impacts actions, thoughts, & feelings
### Schemas
* Underlying representations of knowledge that guide the way info is processed
* **Person schemas** - appearance, behavior, personality, preferences of others
* **Social schemas** - how others should act
* **Self-schemas** - like person schemas, but regarding oneself
* **Event schemas** - how one should act in a given situation
### Attributional Style
* Characteristic ways in which individuals assign causes to pos. & neg. events
* Emerge from temperament, abilities, & experiences
#### Attributional Style Theory
Negative | Positive
--- | ---
Internal causes | External causes e.g. others/circumstances
Stable causes e.g. trait | Changeable causes/temporary state
Global causes (generalizable to different situations) | Specific causes limited to situation
e.g. "I failed this test because I *(internal)* am a bad student *(stable)*" | e.g. "I failed this test because my mom needed me to help out at home *(external)* and I wasn't able to study as much as usual *(changeable)*"
Implies poor outcome will generalize to other tests *(global)* | Implies poor outcome was specific to this situation and won’t generalize to other tests *(specific)*
## Sociocultural Model
* Family
	* Parent/sibling psychopathology
	* Negative/ineffective parenting styles
	* Marital discord
* Peers
	* Unhealthy peer relationships
	* Bullying
	* Social rejection
* Deprivation of essential resources
	* Lack of food/water/shelter/education
	* Neglect/abuse
	* Separation from parents
* Society
	* Poverty
	* Unemployment
	* Discrimination
	* Instability/conflict
