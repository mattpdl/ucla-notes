## Fear & Anxiety
* **Fear** - emotional response to perceived imminent threat
* **Anxiety** - anticipation of future threat

Component | Fear | Anxiety
-- | -- | --
Cognitive/subjective | Danger | Worry
Physiological | Inc'd HR, sweating | Tension, overarousal
Behavioral | Escape/run | Avoidance
### Anxiety
* Psychological, physiological, & behavioral state induced by a potential/actual threat
* Psychological: subjective cognitive & emotional experiences
	* Tension
	* Apprehension
	* Worries
* Changes in behavior
	* Avoidance
	* Impaired speech
	* Impaired performance
* Physiological
	* Muscle tension
	* Rapid breathing
	* Inc'd heart rate
	* Inc'd blood pressure
	* Inc'd arousal: activation of the sympathetic nervous system (HPA axis)
* Goal of response is to improve coping w/ perceived threat
## Anxiety Disorders
* Interferes with ability to cope & function
* Excessive
* Unrealistic/irrational
* Pervasive
* Lasts longer than developmentally appropriate
* Persistent - typically >= 6 mo.
* Causes additional distress
* US lifetime prevalence is 31%, 12 mo. prevalence is 19%
* Global lifetime prevalence around 11%, current prevalence around 7.3%
### DSM-5 Anxiety Disorders
* Specific phobias
* Social phobia
* Generalized anxiety disorder
* Panic disorder
* Agoraphobia
* Distinguishing anxiety disorders
	* Share features of excessive fear & anxiety and related behavioral disturbances
	* Differ from one another in terms of object of fear, anxiety
* Prevalence
	* Phobias & social anxiety most common
	* More common in women
	* Age differences
		* Phobias common in youth
		* GAD common in elderly
	* Highly comorbid w/ depression
		* Anxiety usually develops first
### Biological Factors
* Specific phobias: mixed results, unclear
* GAD: 15-20% of variance related to genetics
* Social phobia: 30% of variance related to genetics
* Panic disorder: 33-40% of variance related to genetics
### Temperament
* Behavioral inhibition demonstrated in longitudinal studies to increase the risk of social anxiety, GAD, & depression
* Parenting style influences behavioral inhibition and parenting itself (via a feedback loop) that can potentially cause psychopathology
### Neurotransmitters
* **Adrenaline** - inc. HR. blood flow, awareness in fight/flight response
* **Noradrenaline** - affects attention, contracts blood vessels, released in tandem w/ adrenaline
* **Serotonin** - well-being & happiness, helps sleep cycle & digestive system, affected by exercise & light exposure
* **GABA** - calming, improves focus but low levels cause anxiety, also contributes to motor control & vision
### Limbic System
* **Prefrontal cortex** - regulates limbic responses of amygdala & hippocampus
* **Hippocampus** - evaluates threat contexts
* **Amygdala** - drives autonomic & emotional responses
### Psychological Factors
* Cognitive
	* Negative & threat schema
	* Info processing biases
* Behavioral
	* Classical conditioning - phobias
	* Avoidance learning
	* Modeling - learned from parents, etc.
* Cognitive errors reinforced by avoidance behavior
	* Overestimation of likelihood of negative event happening
	* Overestimation of severity
	* Avoidance of opportunities to test guesses
## Panic Attacks
* Consist of sudden, intense fear that occurs suddenly
* Commonly mimics symptoms of a heart attack emotionally & physically
* Types of panic attacks
	* **Situationally bound/cued** - occur upon actual/anticipated exposure to certain situations
	* **Situationally predisposed** - more likely to experience a panic attack in certain situations
	* **Unexpected/uncued** - seems to come out of nowhere
### Panic Disorders
* Result from recurrent, sudden, & unexpected panic attacks
	* Anxiety mounts to unbearable level
	* Feeling of inescapable doom
	* Sudden overwhelming experience of terror/fright
* Persistent worry about additional attacks
* Change in behavior & associated impairment
* 4/13 possible physical & cognitive symptoms present in a panic attack
* Lifetime prevalence
	* Panic attacks: 7-28%
	* Panic disorder: 3.4-4.7%
* Psychological causal factors
	* Panic cycle
	* Anticipatory anxiety cycle
	* Avoidance cycle
	* Safety behaviors cycle
	* Panic caused by *cognitive misinterpretation*
	* Panic maintained due to lack of learning that symptoms are not actually harmful
## Specific Phobias
* Irrational fear of specific obj/situation which markedly interferes w/ an individual's ability to function
* One of the most common mental illnesses in the US
* Lifetime prevalence is 12.5%
* Tends to be chronic
### Learning Model
* **Classical conditioning** - previously neutral stimuli begins to elicit behavioral patterns w/ which they have been repeatedly associated
* **Prepared classical conditioning** - certain evolutionarily dangerous objs are prepared to become phobic objs when paired with traumatic conditioning
	* e.g. rhesus monkeys become afraid of snakes but not flowers after modeling
### Subtypes
* Blood-injection-injury
* Natural env (e.g. storms, heights, water)
* Animal (e.g. snakes, spiders, insects, birds)
* Other (e.g. choking, vomiting)
* Situational (e.g. public transportation, tunnels, bridges, elevators, flying, driving, enclosed spaces)
## Treatment
* **Inhibitory transmitters** - make the postsynaptic neuron less likely to fire, e.g. serotonin & GABA
* **Benzodiazepines** (e.g. Valium, Xanax, Klonopin, Ativan) increase GABA activity and inhibit neurons from firing, producing a calming effect
	* Negative side effects like falling asleep at the wheel
	* Dangerous in combination w/ alcohol
	* Physical dependence after a few months of daily use
		* GABA neurons adapt to the drug's presence and are underactive when withdrawn
		* Withdrawal reaction develops after a week to a month or two if the drug is shorter/longer-acting
		* Withdrawal symptoms e.g. nausea, insomnia, seizures, abnormal body sensations, aches, delirium, muscle spasms, anxiety/panic attacks, depression
### SSRIs & SNRIs
* **Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)** e.g. Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro, Celexa, Paxil
	* Block reabsorption of serotonin & norepinephrine into neurons
* **(Selective) serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIS)** e.g. Effexor, Cymbalta
* Inc. levels of serotonin & norepinephrine in the brain
* Selective since they mainly affect serotonin and norepinephrine, not other neurotransmitters
* As effective & safer than benzodiazepines for panic disorder & generalized anxiety
* Also relieve depression
* Take weeks to work (but this makes them less addictive)
### CBT for Panic Disorder
* Goals
	* Learn that feared outcome is unlikely to occur
	* Extinguish anxiety response to physiological sensations
* **Cognitive restructuring** - correct cognitive errors (one feeling that they are having a heart attack) by conducting experiments to see if cognitions are accurate
* **Exposure therapy** - exposure to feared stimulus allowing for new learning/alternative cognitions
	* Avoidance maintains fear and anxiety
* **Systematic desensitization** - may use relaxation techniques in hierarchy of anxiety-provoking situations
* **Interoceptive exposure** - experiencing feared physiological sensations e.g. overbreathing, running quickly, tensing body muscles
	* Pair exposure w/ breathing retraining & cognitive coping strategies
### 3rd Wave Behavior Therapies for GAD
* Acceptance & commitment therapy
* Mindfulness-based interventions
* Focused on persons' relationship to thought & emotion than on content of thoughts
* Present-focused
* Willingness to experience difficult thoughts/feelings/sensations w/o trying to control/avoid them
