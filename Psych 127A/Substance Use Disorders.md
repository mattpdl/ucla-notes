## Substance Use
### Terms
* **Substance use** - taking moderate amts of a substance in a way that doesn't interfere w/ func'ing
* **Substance intoxication** - literally "poisoning", physical reaction to a substance (e.g. being drunk)
	* Induced temp. state of poor judgment
	* Mood changes, irritability, slurred speech, & poor coordination
* **Substance use disorder** - problematic pattern of use that is dangerous, causes substantial impairment (e.g. affecting job/relationships), or distress
* **Tolerance** - needing more of a substance to get the same effect/reduced effects from the same amt
* **Withdrawal** - physical symptom reaction when substance is discontinued after regular use
* **Substance dependence** - may be defined by tolerance & withdrawal
	* Sometimes defined by drug-seeking behavior (e.g. spending too much money on substance)
### Statistics
* About 9% of US teens & adults have a substance use disorder
* Highest rates of substance abuse/dependence in the US found among Native Americans (15.5%), lowest among Asian Americans (3.5%)
* White, Hispanic, & African Americans display rates b/t 9-10%
* Only 11% receive treatment from a mental health professional
## Substance Categories
### Depressants
* Depressants slow activity of CNS
	* Influences several neurotransmitter sys's
	* Specific target is GABA: inc's inhibitory effects, making neural cells worse at firing
* Reduce tension & inhibitions
* May interfere w/ judgment, motor activity, & concentration
* Groups of drugs in this class:
	* **Alcohol**
	* **Sedatives** - calming, e.g. barbiturates
	* **Hypnotic** - sleep inducing, e.g. ambien
	* **Anxiolytic** - anxiety reducing, e.g. benzodiazepines
* All exert influence via the GABA neurotransmitter system
	* Combining such drugs w/ alcohol is synergistic & can be lethal
#### Alcohol
##### Stimulant & Depressant
* At lower levels, alcohol stimulates certain brain cells & activates brain's pleasure areas
* At higher levels, alcohol depresses brain func'ing (lessen judgment, interfere w/ attention, learning, self-control, coordination, slurred speech, etc.)
##### Tolerance & Withdrawal
* As people build up alcohol tolerance, they need to drink greater amounts to feel its effects
* A small percentage of people experience a dramatic & dangerous withdrawal syndrome known as **delirium tremens ("the DTs")** - confusion & body tremors, etc.
* Withdrawal classified as >= 2 symptoms below occurring several hours - few days after cessation/reduction in alcohol use:
	* Autonomic hyperactivity e.g. sweating/fast pulse
	* Hand tremor
	* Insomnia
	* Nausea/vomiting
	* Hallucinations
	* Psychomotor agitation
	* Anxiety
	* Seizures
* Causes clinically significant distress/impairment
##### Long-Term Consequences
* Disruption of relationships, job performance, problems w/ legal authorities
* Associated brain conditions - Korsakoffs (memory problems/difficulty learning new things)
* Fetal alcohol syndrome
* Vitamin/nutritional deficiency
* Multiple health problems e.g. cirrhosis of the liver
### Narcotics
* Bind to receptors in the brain that ordinarily receive endorphins
	* Neurotransmitters that naturally help relieve pain & dec. emotional tension
	* Often referred to as analgesics/painkillers
* **Opiate** - natural chemical derived from the poppy plant
	* e.g. opium, heroin, morphine, codeine
* **Opioids** - partly/synthetic substances that have similar chemical structures as opiates & have same effects on the body
	* e.g. methadone, oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl
* Each drug has a different strength, speed of action, & tolerance level
	* Low doses induce euphoria, drowsiness, & slowed breathing
	* High doses can result in death
	* High risk for HIV infection due to shared needles
#### Withdrawal
* Withdrawal symptoms can be lasting & severe
	* Nausea & vomiting
	* Muscle aches
	* Sweating
	* Diarrhea
	* Yawning
	* Fever
	* Insomnia
	* Restlessness
	* Dysphoric mood
* If dependent, withdrawal begins w/in 6-12 hr. after use
	* Peaks after 1-3 days
	* Begins to subside after 5-7 days
### Stimulants
* Most widely consumed drugs in the US: caffeine & nicotine
* Inc. activity of CNS: inc. alertness & inc. energy
* Produce varied levels of elation, vigor, & reduce fatigue
	* Enhance release of norepinephrine & dopamine
	* Reuptake is often subsequently blocked
* Withdrawal characterized by fatigue & depression (varies by substance)
* Four most common stimulants:
	* Caffeine
	* Nicotine
	* Cocaine
	* Amphetamines
#### Cocaine
* Short-lived sensations (5 min. - 2 hr.) of elation, vigor, reduced fatigue
* Effects result from blocking the reuptake of dopamine
* Highly addictive, but addiction develops slowly
* Withdrawal characterized by apathy & boredom => leads to desire to use again
#### Other Stimulants
* **Crystal meth/methamphetamine** - high risk of dependence
	* 4-6 hr.
	* Inc. alertness, confidence, sexual drive; dec. fatigue
	* Can inc. irritability anxiety, aggression
	* Inc. heart rate & blood pressure & reduces appetite 
* **MDMA (Ecstasy)** - structurally related to amphetamines w/ a chemical attachment that makes it also resemble the structure of hallucinogen mescaline
* Some ADHD drugs are mild stimulants e.g. adderall, ritalin
#### Long-Term Use
* Effects followed by fatigue & depression ("crash")
* Withdrawal: dysphoric mood, fatigue, unpleasant dreams, sleep problems, psychomotor retardation/agitation
* Inc. risk of stroke, heart attack
### Hallucinogens
* Change the way the user perceives the world
* Cause individuals to see/hear things in different & unusual ways
* May produce delusions, paranoia, hallucinations, altered sensory perception
	* "expand one's mind"/feel detached from one's body
* Acting on neural circuits that use serotonin
	* Particularly impact the prefrontal cortex: mood, cognition, & perception
* Tolerance & withdrawal are rare
* Risks:
	* Users may experience a "bad trip" - very unpleasant, perceptual, emotional, & behavioral reactions
	* Flashbacks which can occur days/months after last drug use
* Ranked from less to more intense:
	* Cannabis
	* LSD, MDMA (ecstasy)
	* Mescaline (from Peyote cactus)
	* Psilocybin ("magic mushrooms")
	* Phencyclidine ("angel dust"/PCP)
#### Cannabis/THC
* Produced from varieties of the hemp plant *(cannabis sativa)*
	* Hashish - solidified resin of cannabis plant
	* Marijuana - mixture of buds, crushed leaves, & flowering tops
* Active ingredient is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
* Drug is more powerful w/ greater THC content
* THC has similar chemical structure to anandamide, which is an endogenous cannabinoids
	* Endogenous cannabinoids play key role in regulating mood, pain perception, learning & memory among others
* 5-15% people in Western countries smoke/use marijuana regularly
##### Effects
* Euphoria, relaxation, distortions in sense of time, vision, hearing
* Sleepiness, increased appetite, slowed reaction time, loss of coordination
* Impaired learning & memory, paranoia, anxiety, panic attacks, hallucinations
* Withdrawal symptoms can occur w/ daily use for at least a few months
##### Negative Outcomes
* May affect reproduction: lower sperm count in males, abnormal ovulation in women
* Heavy use during adolescence may incr. risk for later psychosis
### Other Drugs of Abuse
* Inhalants
* Anabolic steroids
* Medications
## Substance Use Disorders
* Pattern of substance use leading to significant impairment & distress
### Symptoms 
* Need 2+ symptoms w/in a yr.
* Impaired control
	* Taking more of substance than intended
	* Desire to cut down use
	* Excessive time spent using/acquiring/recovering
	* Craving for the substance
* Functional impairment
	* Role disruption (e.g. can't perform at work)
	* Interpersonal problems
	* Reduction of important activities
* Risky/dangerous behavior
	* Use in physically hazardous situations (e.g. driving)
	* Keep using despite causing physical/psychological problems
* Physiological changes
	* Tolerance
	* Withdrawal
### Causes
#### Genetics
* Substance abuse has a genetic component
	* Certain genes have been found to confer risk for heroin abuse
	* Concordance rates for alcohol use disorder in identical/monozygotic (MZ) vs. fraternal/dizygotic (DZ) twins:
		* Males: 56% vs. 33%
		* Females: 30% vs 17%
* Much of focus on alcohol use disorder
	* Genetic differences in alcohol metabolism > impact which drugs are most effective for treating alcohol use disorders
	* Personality traits e.g. sensation seeking, binge drinking
* Multiple genes involved in substance abuse
##### Differential Response to Endorphins
* **Endorphins (endogenous opioids)** - natural pain relievers
	* Released during exercise, excitement, etc., but also alcohol & opiates
	* Produce analgesia & feeling of well-being
	* Involved in controlling pain, emotion, stress
* Some individuals may experience an exaggerated activation of the endogenous opioid system in response to substances like alcohol
#### Psychological
* Role of pos./neg. reinforcement
	* Early on, drug use may be seeking a euphoric high (pos. reinforcement)
	* Later, drug use will be seeking escape from withdrawal (neg. reinforcement)
* Opponent-process theory
	* Crash after drug use fails to keep people from using
	* Drugs themselves are easiest way to alleviate feelings of withdrawal
* Cognitive factors
	* Role of expectancy effects: people use drugs when they anticipate pos. effects
* Cravings
	* Triggered by cues: mood, environment, availability of drug
* Expectations
* Desire for peer acceptance
* Pressure for social performance
* Binge drinking: sensation seeking & impulsivity
##### Comorbidity & Self-Medication
* Means to cope w/ negative affect:
	* Self medication, tension reduction
	* Drugs offer escape from life stressors
* Anxiety
* Depression
* PTSD
* Antisocial personality disorder
* Conduct disorder (in adolescence)
#### Cultural
* Exposure to drugs is a prereq for use of drugs
	* Media, family, peers
	* Parents & the family appear critical
* Societal views about drug abuse
	* Sign of moral weakness: failure of self-control
	* Sign of a disease: caused by some underlying process
* Cultural expectations of substances may influence drug-related behavior
	* Some cultures expect heavy drinking at certain social occasions
	* If drinking is thought to incr. aggressiveness, people may act in more aggressive ways after drinking
#### Integrative Model
* Exposure/access to drug is necessary, but not sufficient
* Drug use depends on:
	* Social & cultural expectations
	* Pos. & neg. reinforcement
	* Genetic predisposition & biological factors
	* Psychosocial stressors
### Treatment
#### Biological
* **Agonist substitution**
	* Safe drug w/ similar chemical composition as abused drug
	* e.g. methadone, nicotine gum/patch
* **Antagonist treatment**
	* Drugs that block/counteract the pos. effects of substances
	* e.g. naltrexone for opiate & alcohol problems
* **Aversive treatment**
	* Drugs that make use of substances extremely unpleasant
	* e.g. Antabuse (alcohol), silver nitrate (nicotine)
* Efficacy of biological treatment
	* Generally ineffective when used alone
	* Used to help w/ withdrawal symptoms
##### Detoxification
* Alcohol withdrawal: hand tremors, sweating, nausea, anxiety, insomnia, convulsions & hallucinations
* Benzodiazepines
	* Cross-tolerant w/ alcohol & stimulate the GABA
	* During withdrawal from alcohol, benzodiazepines may serve as a substitute/agonist
	* Reduce withdrawal severity & incidence of seizures & delirium tremens
* Opiates: methadone, buprenorphine, clonidine
#### Psychosocial
* Inpatient vs. outpatient care: little diff in effectiveness
* Community support programs: Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) & related groups (e.g. NA) may be helpful
* Balancing treatment goals: controlled use vs. complete abstinence
* Component treatment
	* Inc. several elements e.g. psychotherapy & contingency mgmt (CM)
	* CM: giving patients tangible rewards to reinforce pos. behaviors e.g. abstinence
##### Motivational Interviewing
* Therapist is directive w/ goal of eliciting self-motivational statements & behavioral change from the client in addition to creating client discrepancy to enhance motivation for pos. change
* Counseling style based on following assumptions:
	* Ambivalence about substance use & change is normal and constitutes an important motivational obstacle in recovery
	* Ambivalence can be resolved by working w/ client's intrinsic motivations & values
	* Alliance between therapist & client is collaborative partnership to which important expertise is brought by each
	* Empathic, supportive, yet directive counseling style provides conditions under which change can occur
##### CBT for AUD
* Recognize & respond to precipitating situations (coping skills)
* Relapse prevention
##### Prevention
* Recent shift away from education approaches
* Greater enforcement of anti-drug laws e.g. nicotine taxes, smoking ordinances
