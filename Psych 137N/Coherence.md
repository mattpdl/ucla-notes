## Coherence
* **Construing** - integrating multiple elems into a meaningful singular whole
* **Coherence** - process of integrating across multiple inputs (i.e. generating coherence) and also the sensibility/meaningfulness of the results (i.e. experienced coherence)
### Constraint Satisfaction
* Potential solution for generating effortless coherence
* Multiple solutions constrain each other (can't all be true)
* Assumes certain biologically plausible features of neurons representing possible outcomes
	* Interactions of these features naturally produce coherent solutions
* No gold standard for truth, so focus on reducing *tension* b/t sets of activated representations
* Low tension in system = coherent solution
* Coherence does not guarantee truth
### Constraints
* Things that don't easily go together in the world
	* When one happens, it seems to try to prevent the other from happening
* Psychological constraints
	* In our mental models of the world, we have implicit expectations about what does and does not go together
	* We mentally assume “old man” and “very strong” do not go together and so they are neurally wired to constrain each other through inhibitory connections between the concepts
		* Our brain predicts if one is present, the other probably is not present
* **Constrain satisfaction** - a mathematical procedure for automatically doing a pretty good job of satisfying as many constraints as possible which usually produces a pretty good “answer” or “solution”
	* But can also be very wrong
## Constraint Satisfaction
### Definitions
* **Node/unit activation**
	* Parts of the model/brain that repr. something like a concept/part of an image
	* More active units mean that the thing repr'd by that node is part of the current story of what is happening
* **Weights/connection strength**
	* Strength of connections b/t nodes/units
	* **Positive weights** - nodes reinforce each other
		* Model assumes 2 connected nodes repr. things that go together in the world
	* **Negative weights** - nodes inhibit each other
		* Model assumes 2 connected nodes repr. things that don't go together
* **Iterative updating** - in each round, each node influences the others it is connected to according to its own strength of activation & the weight connecting it to other nodes
	* If node 1 highly active & has neg. conn. to node 2, then node 1 will inhibit node 2
* **Tension** - amt of inhibitory signals in the network at a point time
* **Attractor state/local minimum**
	* A settled state of the model where additional updating does not lower the tension further
	* A stable subjective construal
### Landscape View
* Landscape is all potential states of network
* Ball repr. current state of network
* Up/down dimension repr. tension in each spot of the landscape
* Valleys (attractor states/local minima) repr. relatively coherent solutions where some units reinforce each other and others quieted (thru inhibition/activation)

### Parallel Constraint Satisfaction
* Depending on exact conn. weights, strength of initial activation of units, & seq of unit activation, very diff solutions can emerge dynamically over very short time
* No logic/propositional thought required
* No single node essential across 1000s involved
* Can explain why diff people see things differently
* "Constraint satisfaction starts out like a democracy where every idea gets a vote, but ends up like an authoritarian regime where dissent is crushed"
### Attractor States
* **Attractor states** - states of the network that minimize tension
* **Tension** - total inhibitory contributions from units to each other at a point in time
* **Unit activation** - strength of the represented thing in the current solution/construal
* Once you get close to attractor, mutually reinforcing units gain steam and draw you in
	* Much easier to get into attractor state than to get out of it, takes less energy
* Attractor states are like subjective construals
	* Bringing together various elems into single global interpretation
	* Represent your subjectivity in the presence of those inputs
* Updating rule: $\textrm{Previous state} + \sum (\textrm{other nodes} \times \textrm{connection})$
#### Priming
* **Priming** - subliminally flashing a stimulus before another, influencing one's perception in the immediate aftermath
* In general, priming can influence initial unit activation
	* e.g. subliminally flashing "duck" before presenting an ambiguous duck-rabbit image can influence a duck attractor state
### Takeaways
* Inputs from the world are processed constructively through connectionist models that make assumptions about the world  
* Initially matched evidence for two construals can end up with one unambiguous construal in our experience
* **‘Winner takes all’ effect** - slight differences in landscape between two people can produce massive differences in how they see the world
* Small priming and sequence effects can produce big differences
* Since this happens automatically, we are unaware of these dynamic processes and can’t appreciate it
* Can’t unscramble eggs – things quickly spiral into attractor states that can’t be undone easily
* The shape of the landscape is all about connection weights  
* The current state of the model is all about unit activation  
* A construal is generated by lots of inputs simultaneously competing, forming coalitions, and reaching attractor states  
* Lots of things constraint satisfaction processes can’t represent  
	* Propositions, absences, negations  
	* Can sometimes mimic the functionality of those the way a calculator appears to do math (but doesn’t really do math) or how ChatGPT appears to understand (but doesn’t really understand)
	* Reflective processing needed to the things it can’t do
## Brain's Influence on Coherence
### Illusory Contours
* Perceived presence of objs/parts of objs that aren't really there
![[illusory-contours.png]]
### Amodal Completion
* Adaptation paradigm
* Seeing the same thing for the 2nd time in a row reqs less neural activity
![[amodal-completion.png]]
### Multisensory Integration (McGurk Effect)
* Sensory experiences are integrated b/c certain sensory experiences normally together
* In a video demonstration, audio of "ba ba ba" sounds like "fa fa fa" when the accompanying frames indicate the latter expression being mouthed
* The brain, being visually-driven, assumes that mouth expressions match heard speech in a reliable way
### Simultagnosia (Balint's Syndrome)
* Rare disorder assoc'd w/ deficits in processing mult. objs/features of objs together
* Described as leaving "a patient's world unglued"
