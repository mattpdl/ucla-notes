## Views on Consciousness
* **Dualism** - two realms of existence: physical & non-physical spirit/soul
	* *Fatal flaw:* if body and brain/consciousness are separate, unclear what mechanism by which the two communicate (Descartes)
* **Idealism** - primary reality is mental, physical world being an illusion
* **Materialism** - primary reality is physical, the mind being the physical/func'l props of the brain & having a scientific explanation
	* *Fatal flaw:* if the universe if physicalistic, consciousness shouldn't exist at all
* Undergrad study: 48% believe in dualism, 8% idealism, 44% materialism
	* Where people draw the line between what has consciousness or not: most between ant/worm & tree
		* Yourself, Others, Monkey, Dog, Squirrel, Fish, Ant/Worm, Tree, Thermostat, Rock
* Grad students & faculty study:
	* Most believe machines could develop consciousness, cognitive understanding insufficient, & consciousness developed evolutionarily
	* Most do not conceptualize a sharp boundary b/t un/conscious processing
## Fundamentals
* Consciousness gives life meaning
* Cannot ascertain why consciousness exists, how to reverse engineer it
* Consciousness might be a special nothingness
