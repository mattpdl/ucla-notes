## Subjective Construal
* Personal interpretation/understanding of a situation
* Construal from the Latin *construere* (to build up, pile together)
	* Constructive process, not just a replica of the world in our heads
* Typically feel like part of the reality of the situation, not our interpretations layered on top
* Bertrand Russell: "The observer, when he seems to himself to be observing a stone, is really...observing the effects of the stone upon himself"
* High level quality - where subjectivity meets reality
	* What it's like to be a bat vs. what it's like to be in this situation/context
	* Combined influence of sensory inputs from world & our existing brain
### Prisoner's Dilemma
* Selfish - maximize money for self at expense of other player
* Cooperative - maximize money for 
* 68% pursue selfish strategy if described as "Wall Street Game," but drops to 28% when described as the "Community Game"
* Different behavior when game is labeled differently
	* The rules are completely identical
	* Labels don't change behavior directly
* Labels change pre-reflective understanding (subjective construal) of the game
	* The goal of "Wall Street Game" construed as winning as much money as possible
	* The goal of "Community Game" construed as helping the group do the best
	* What the game "objectively is" has changed
* Our construal of the situation, *not the situation per se*, drives behavior
	* *It is* a competitive/cooperative game, depending on the label
	* Doesn't feel like an interpretation
## CEEing
* Effortless meaning making
* 55+ languages share a word for *see* in both "I *see* the mountain" & "I *see* what you mean"
* **CEEing** - coherent effortless experiences w/ the intuitive givenness of vision
* **Gestalt Cortex** - visual, semantic, & psychological CEEing

| Type                           | Example                        | Visible Components                      | Non-visible Components                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Visual ("seeing matter")       | "I see a mountain"             | Aspects of obj facing individual        | Aspect of obj not facing individual, occluded parts of objs, hidden features (e.g. obj's weight) |
| Psychological ("seeing minds") | "I see the baby wants the toy" | Facial cues, bodily movements & actions | Minds, mental states, & traits                                                                   |
| Semantic ("seeing meaning")    | "I see what you mean"          | Written words                           | Semantic meaning, narrative arc                                                                  |
### CEEing Model
* **Proposition 1** - pre-reflective subjective construals are coherent, effortless, & experiential (i.e. CEEing) processes associated w/ gestalt cortex
	* **Proposition 1.1** - Gestalt cortex assoc'd w/ conscious experience
	* **Proposition 1.2** - Gestalt cortex not assoc'd w/ conscious thought
	* **Proposition 1.3** - Nonconscious processes that do not influence conscious experience occur outside gestalt cortex
	* **Proposition 1.4** - Gestalt cortex assoc'd w/ effortless, rather than effortful processes
	* **Proposition 1.5** - Coherence via integration across multiple psychological elements occurs in *gestalt cortex* & w/ conscious experience
### Gestalt Cortex
* **IPL** - inferior (bottom) parietal lobule
* **TPJ** - temporoparietal junction
* **PTC** - posterior temporal cortex
* **VTC** - ventral (bottom)

### Types of Coherence
* ⬆ Dorsal
* **Scene** - where/how
* **Psychological** - why
* **Entity** - who/what
* ⬇️ Ventral
