## Pre-Reflective Experiences
### Philosophy
* G.A. Tawney (1908) - discussed how pre-reflective experiences lack a consciousness of relations & subject/object distinction until one reflects
* William James (1890) - described consciousness as a stream of thought
	* "The attempt at introspective analysis in these cases is in fact like *seizing a spinning top to catch its motion*"
* Jean-Paul Sartre (1958) - "Unreflected thought undergoes a radical modification in becoming reflected"
### Reflective Altering Pre-Reflective
* Showing someone a song
* Reflecting on & naming your feelings
### Fringe of Pre-Reflective
* Felt feelings of "rightness/coherence", "familiarity", "casual connection", & "mineness"
* Non-sensory experiences are:
	* Translucent
		* No sensory content of their own
	* Low resolution
		* Fuzzy, slurred, cloud-like in contrast to the detail of typical focal sensory experience
	* Elusive
		* Easier to verify indirectly while holding focal sensory experience constant (e.g. seeing somewhere the 1st vs. nth time)
	* More evident in the periphery of experience than at attentive focus
## Intentionality (Consciousness "of")
* Husserl's claim in phenomenology
	* "All consciousness is consciousness of something"
	* Rocks and tubes of toothpaste just "are," but they aren't "about" anything
* Reflective consciousness is always "consciousness of"
* Pre-reflective experience can be "of" but often isn't
### Philosophy
* Alex Byrne (2001) - "When one sees a cat, one's experience is 'about' the cat: this is the representational or intentional component of the experience"
* William James (1890) - "whenever we try introspectively to describe one of our [experiences], of dropping the [experience] as it is in itself and talking of something else. We describe other thoughts *about* those things - as if these and the original thought were the same."
* Pre-reflective experience can be "of" (when focal) but often isn't
	* Parafoveal perception
	* Parafoveal mental stuff ("fringe" stuff that is not focal but not unconscious)
	* Parafoveal associations & feeling
## Consciousness "as" Constituted Unity
* Reflective experience is *about* something & separated from the world
	* "Aboutness" is present when reflecting on the world constituting one's experience
	* Consciousness "of" the elements that until then were fused together in an immersive whole
	* Reflective experience has intentionality, but pre-reflective may not
* Pre-reflective consciousness constitutes *as the world* we are immersed in prior to thinking about it
	* The world as presented in pre-reflective experience is what constitutes your conscious experience
	* Initial experience is not "about" what the world, but *is* the world
	* Pre-reflectively, there is no distinction between the world & one's experience
	* Pre-reflective consciousness is the world that fills it
* Pre-reflective experience is hard to capture and put into words
	* The non-changing parts are easier to capture and put into words
	* Because thinking is reflective, we are biased towards thinking about the parts that can be put into words and ignoring the parts that can't
	* Reflecting on experience can alter/distort the experience
		* Lose the motion & context
