## Conscious Visual Recognition
* Bar (2001) presented stimuli for 26 ms b/t masks and unmasked, measuring signals in these brain regions:
	* **V1** - earliest visual region in the brain
	* **OTS** - part of ventral temporal cortex (VTC) & gestalt cortex
* Demonstrated that gestalt cortex is only activated when stimuli is recognized consciously
* Higher V1 activity associated w/ masking, not recognition

## Face Processing
* *Effortless & pre-reflective*
* **Pareidolia** - see faces where they aren't there
* Assoc'd w/ the **fusiform face area (FFA)** in the gestalt cortex

### Configural Face Processing
* Brains evolved to process upright faces; i.e. two eyes, nose, & mouth
* Just as we have gestalt processes that glue together illusory contours into a coherent whole, we develop expert processes that glue together the elems of a face into a coherent whole
* With faces, only works in right side up, normally encountered perspective
* Yin (1969) found that we were only slightly worse at recognizing houses and airplanes upside down, but dramatically worse at faces
* Configural processing is *conscious but effortless*
## Reverse Hierarchy Theory
1. Not conscious/detail focused processing
2. Conscious (no effort), abstract/gist
3. Conscious w/ effort (detail focused)

## Overflow vs. Inflation
* How can we find out whether there can be conscious experience without the reflective processing required for reporting conscious experience?
* GWT folks think that being aware of what we are experiencing is what makes that a conscious experience
	* Ability to report is *part of the phenomenon* rather than something that *reveals the phenomenon*
* **Sparse** vs. **rich** **experience**
	* Advocates of **sparse experience** argue that the limits of working memory and reflective thinking are the limits of experience
	* Advocates of **rich experience** allow that more is experienced than we can report (it overflows beyond what is reportable from working memory)
		* Rich experience **overflows** beyond what is reportable from working memory
* **Overflow** vs. **inflation**
	* Does phenomenal experience **overflow** the limits of working memory and focused attention?
		* Is there more experienced than working memory and reflective consciousness can capture?
	* Or, is the perceived richness of our experience an illusion such that our brain **inflates** our sense of how much we experience?
