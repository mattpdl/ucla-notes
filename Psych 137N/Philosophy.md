## Consciousness Theories
* **Consciousness** - knowledge *(in general, or reflection)*, intentionality *(aboutness)*, introspection *(and the knowledge it generates)*, phenomenal experience
* **Mind-Body Dualism** (Descartes)
	* **Res Cogitans** - realm of thought
	* **Res Extensa** - realm of extension/physical space 
	* Pineal gland anchors interaction b/t mind & body
* **Monad theory (panpsychism)** - belief that all plants, objects, etc. have a mind-like aspect *(monads)* perceiving the world
	* Extent of self-consciousness varies across monads
	* Largely unpopular since introduced by Leibniz but gaining traction
* **Immaterialism (Idealism)** - all aspects of consciousness only exist within consciousness itself (George Berkeley)
* **Physicalism (Materialsm)** - belief that everything in the universe, including the mind & body, is physical (Hobbes)
	* All mental states are identical to certain types of physical states
	* Mental states are nothing but physical states (in the brain)
## Qualia
* **Immediate**
* **Intrinsic**
* **Ineffable** - unable to experience qualia in any way except for yourself
* **Individual** - interpersonal comparisons of qualia are impossible, one's experience of "red" not necessarily the same for others
* Qualia make no sense in the context of a materialistic science
## Phenomenology
* **Phenomenon** - how something appears in one's experience, "appearances as opposed to reality"
* **Noumenon** - how something is in reality as independent of our experience of it
* **Phenomenology** (from Husserl's *Logical Investigations*) - approach that concentrates on the study of consciousness & the objects of direct experience *(phenomena)*, not the "real" objects *(noumena)* which are rational inferences
