## Approaches
* **Information Integration Theory (IIT)** - global consciousness, posterior "hot zone", photo diodes are conscious
* **Higher-order Theory (HOT)** - perception must be accompanied by thought, PFC focused, animals aren't conscious
* **Recurrent Processing Theory (RPT)** - looped processing in sensory areas creates consciousness
* **Global Neural Workspace Theory (GNWT)** - looped processing in working memory frontoparietal cortex creates consciousness
## Information Integration Theory (IIT)
### Perturbational Complexity Index
* **Integration** - extent to which diff brain regions are doing the same thing in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), suggesting they are working together
* **Differentiation** - no. of diff patterns of brain activity set in motion by TMS
	* High differentiation: brain enters series of diff states over time
	* Low differentiation: brain stays in similar states
* May reflect necessary conditions for, but not actually consciousness itself
### Phi
* **Ï†** - amt of info gen'd by a complex of elements (e.g. neurons), above & beyond the info gen'd by its parts
### Objections
* Info is not a Galilean primary quality (observer relative/derived intentionality)
* Necessary but not sufficient / affirming the consequent
	* e.g. "if conscious then integrated info" does not imply "if lots of integrated info then conscious" 
* Unfalsifiable
* Many systems likely conscious
## Recurrent Processing Theories (RPT)
### Re-entry (Reentrant) Theory
* Initial feedforward sweep in visual cortex is followed by backpropagation/recurrent processing
* Key loops from higher to lower visual areas
* Recurrent processing essential for conscious experience (no consciousness if you block it)
## Global Neural Workspace Theory (GNWT)
* Baars (1988)
### Comparison to RPT
* RPT focuses on recurrent processing in only the visual cortex
* GNWT emphasizes broadcast to fronto-parietal network which makes info available to different systems in the brain (i.e. working memory, consciousness)
### Principles
* Conscious mental states are those consciously available to wide variety of cognitive processes
	* e.g. attention ,evaluation, memory, verbal report
* Sensory info gains access to consciousness when it is "broadcast" to anatomically widespread neuronal workspace implemented across higher order cortical association areas
* $\textrm{Global workspace} = \textrm{Working memory}$
* GNWT closely aligned with regions involved in focal attention & working memory processes
* **Ignition** - converts brief nonconscious activation (e.g. early visual areas) into self-sustaining "reverberant network" in fronto-parietal network
### Objections
* Attention & WM are inherently *effortful* processes, but most conscious processing is *effortless*
* Detection paradigms are weird
	* "We don't live a life where things are flashed at us for 16 ms and then disappear"
* Everyday consciousness isn't like detection
* Detection paradigms ignore pre-reflective processing
* PFC does not seem required for basic conscious experience
	* Many PFC lesion studies w/ no effects on consciousness
	* Compare to achromatopsia where consciousness of color is gone altogether under all conditions due to posterior lesions
* PFC about self-report
* Impoverished view of subjectivity
## Conclusions
* Theories have diff foci
	* Level of consciousness (IIT), phenomenal experience (RPT), reflection on phenomenal experience (HOT/GNWT)
* None tell us why we have consciousness or why it feels the way it does
* Most focus on conscious detection of unusual stimuli
* Not like most everyday conscious experiences
